INTRODUCTION
</h1>

<p>
The calculus of fluxions, the most important addition
that ever was made to the fabric of abstract science, was
invented in the latter part of the seventeenth century.
Considered as a purely intellectual speculation, it far
transcends any theory that had been previously known in
pure mathematics ; and it is not less estimable by reason
of its applicability to physical knowledge. By its powers
as an instrument of analysis, the science of geometry has
been exceedingly enlarged ; and the elegant speculations
of the ancient geometers now go but a little way into the
vast field of knowledge which has been laid open by the
fluxional calculus, the sublime discoveries of Apollonius
and Archimedes being merely easy deductions from more
extended theories. It has, further, rendered most efficient
aid in the investigation of the laws of nature, more especially
in establishing the true theory of the motions of the
heavenly bodies, which, without its assistance, could not
have attained its present high position in the scale of human
knowledge.
</p>
<p>
It may easily be supposed that the invention of the
calculus was not at once fully revealed to the world.
Its principles being inherent in the nature of geometrical
magnitude, they would of course be gradually disclosed
with the advance of mathematical science.
</p>
<p>
As long as the geometers of antiquity confined their
speculations to the comparison of figures bounded by
straight lines, there was no difficulty. The axioms and
the mental process of conceiving the magnitudes compared
to be placed one upon another, was sufficient to establish
the equality of triangles in the cases when these
could be brought entirely to coincide. The principle of
superposition might have been carried further in the elements,
so as to prove the equality of parallelograms, which
are the complements of those about the diameter of a
parallelogram ; also of parallelograms having equal bases
and altitudes ; and the equality of the square on the hypotenuse
of a right angled triangle to the squares on its
sides. In fact, the doctrines of plane geometry were sufficient
to prove that any two equal rectilineal figures admit
always of being decomposed into spaces, such that,
corresponding to every space in one of the figures, there
may be found a space exactly equal and similar to it in
the other figure ; so that in this way any two equal rectilineal
figures, however dissimilar, may yet, by division, be
brought to coincide.
</p>
<p>
The principle of superposition, which was sufficient for
the comparison of rectilineal plane figures, one with another,
could not, however, be extended to the comparison
of rectilineal with curvilineal, or of curvilineal with
curvilineal figures. In treating of these, the ancients
found it necessary to introduce new notions and modes
of demonstration into geometry ; and the difficulty which
occurred in reasoning about curvilineal figures gave rise to
the method of exhaustions, the most refined and important
of their geometrical theories.
</p>
<p>
The fundamental principle of the method of exhaustions
is this very simple proposition, that the difference of any
two unequal quantities, by which the greater exceeds the
less, may be added to itself so often, as to exceed any
finite quantity of the same kind. On this the geometers
of antiquity founded their propositions concerning curvilineal
figures. By its aid they found that polygons may
be inscribed in circles, which shall differ from them by
less than any assignable space ; and hence they might infer
that the circles have to each other the same ratio as don.
similar polygons inscribed in them, namely, the squares
of their diameters. Although in this way they could assure
themselves of the truth of the propositions, yet as
this kind of proof was of a looser nature than that by
which they established their more elementary doctrines,
they fortified it against all cavil by their usual mode of
synthetic demonstration, proving that the square of the
diameter of one circle was to that of another as the first
circle to a space that was neither less nor greater than
the second, and therefore exactly equal to it. By a like
process they proved that a cone is one third of a cylinder
of the same base and altitude ; and from the demonstrations
which they gave of these propositions, it might be
concluded in general, that when two variable quantities
which have a constant ratio approach to two determined
quantities, so as to differ at last from them by less than
any assignable space, the same constant ratio is also the
ratio of the determined quantities, which are the limits of
the variable quantities.
</p>
<p>
The cautious way in which the ancients proceeded in
finally establishing the truth of their propositions concerning
the proportions of solids, could be of very little use in
their original discovery. Indeed we may reasonably suppose,
that in the first instance they arrived at a knowledge
of their truth by a much shorter road, probably in a way
not very different from that followed by the earlier geometers
in modern times, who have extended their theories.
But whatever path they followed, it led them to some
truths of the highest importance at the time they were
first known. After ages of fruitless labour in attempting
to square the circle, the fine discoveries of Archimedes,
that the parabola was two thirds of its circumscribing parallelogram,
and the sphere two thirds of its circumscribing
cylinder, and its surface four times that of one of its
great circles, must have been received by his contemporaries
with high satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
In the beginning of the seventeenth century, the writings
of Archimedes greatly engaged the attention of the
principal cultivators of mathematical science, who soon
seized the spirit of his method, which was altogether distinct
from the unwieldy machinery of the ancient mode
of synthetic demonstration. He had only considered such
solids as could be generated by the revolution of conic
sections about an axis, and he had not even exhausted all
the cases of these. The celebrated Kepler greatly extended
this theory, in a treatise which he composed on the
mensuration of round solids. These he conceived to be
formed by the revolution of the conic sections about any
ordinate, or a tangent to the curve at the vertex, or, in
short, about any line whatever within or without the curve.
In this way he described about ninety new solids, and
proposed them as problems for the consideration of his
contemporaries ; but of these he resolved only a few of
the most simple. In this work he first introduced the
name and notion of infinity into the language of geometry.
He considered the circle as composed of an
infinite number of triangles, having their vertex at the
centre, and forming the circumference by their bases.
The cone he regarded as composed of an infinite number
of pyramids, resting on the infinitely small triangles which
formed its circular base, and having their vertices at its
vertex ; and he supposed a cylinder of the same base and
altitude as the cone to be made up of prisms having the
same bases and altitudes as those which composed the
cone.
</p>
<p>
The hold extension which Kepler thus gave to the cautious
language of geometry drew the attention of his contemporaries,
some of whom eagerly followed in his steps.
Cavalieri, a friend and disciple of Galileo, embodied the
new views in his geometry of indivisibles, the theory of
which he possessed in 1629, although it was not published
until 1635. In this work, lines were considered as
made up of points, surfaces as composed of lines, and solids
as formed of surfaces. Cavalieri was exceedingly careful
to verify his method, comparing his results with those
which had been established by the ancient geometrical
mode of demonstration ; and, assured by their agreement,
he ventured boldly in his new career. His principles
were attacked, but he defended them by showing that
they might be translated into those of Archimedes, from
which they only differed in brevity of expression ; his
surfaces and lines being in fact merely the thin solids and
small inscribed and circumscribed triangles of the ancient
geometer, and their number being supposed so great that
the difference between them and the figure about which
they were described was less than any assignable quantity.
</p>
<p>
The new views proposed by Kepler were taken up in
France by Roberval, who had carefully studied the writings
of Archimedes, and formed a theory by which he
could resolve problems concerning curvilineal figures.
Instead of supposing lines to be made up of points, and
surfaces of lines, as had been assumed by Cavalieri, he
regarded a line as composed of an infinite number of infinitely
short lines, a surface as composed of an infinite
number of infinitely narrow surfaces, and so on ; an assumption
which at bottom was the same as that of the Italian
geometer, but capable of being wrought up into a theory
differing less from the spirit of the ancient geometry. Roberval
concealed his views, employing them secretly as the
means of invention in geometry, and expecting in this way
to get the start of his contemporaries in reputation as a
geometer. In the meanwhile the work of Cavalieri appeared
and frustrated his selfish expectations.
</p>
<p>
The facility which the introduction of the notion of infinitely
small quantities gave in the extension of geometry,
induced all the mathematicians of that day to employ it in
their researches. In the doctrine of curve lines it was
applied to the theory of tangents by Roberval, Descartes,
and Fermat, with great success. So very near had this last-mentioned
geometer approached to the fluxional or differential
calculus, that Laplace says he ought to be reputed
its true inventor. Laplace was no doubt a great authority ;
but the facts on which he formed his opinion have
always been generally known, and no one before him has
attempted to reverse the decision of the age in which the
calculus was invented. The justice of the decision has been
subjected to a scrutiny by men of the highest powers of
mind, who, differing in many of their opinions, have yet
agreed in ascribing the invention to others.
</p>
<p>
The problem of drawing tangents to curves is indeed
closely connected with the calculus, and at the period
when this was about to be revealed that problem was
much agitated, and successfully resolved by Slusius, Wallis,
Barrow, and others. The writings and discoveries of
Descartes exerted a most beneficial influence on the new
geometry, particularly by his happy application of algebra
to geometry. Before his time geometrical problems had
been resolved by algebra, and a rich mine of discovery
thereby opened. But he was the first who thought of applying
algebraic formulæ to express the nature of curve
lines ; an invention of vast importance to both branches
of mathematical science.
</p>
<p>
Another most important benefit that resulted from the
new views which Descartes brought forward, was the notion
of <i>variable quantity</i>. The early analysts distinguished
quantities chiefly from the circumstance of their being
known or unknown ; and the main object of inquiry
with them was to discover the chain of reasoning by which
they might pass from the given quantities to the determination
of those required. The view which Descartes took
of geometrical magnitude brought the <i>relations</i> of quantities
forward as a principal subject of contemplation. A
new subject of discussion was brought into mathematical
science, namely, the changes which take place in quantities
connected by an invariable relation, when one of
them is supposed to change its value, and pass from one
state of magnitude to another. The science of geometry
owes its elegance and the variety of its doctrines to the
combined effect of magnitude and position, as they influence
the subjects under consideration ; and, in addition to
these, the doctrine of curve lines has introduced a new
element, namely, the property of varying in magnitude, as
an attribute of quantity. This property of indefinitude,
in respect of greatness, although it may appear a trivial
affection of quantity, has, however, led to the most important
consequences ; for from this, combined with other
principles, have sprung the fluxional calculus and other
mathematical theories, which, originating in the ordinary
conceptions of the human mind, have engaged the attention
of men endowed with the highest powers of intellect
for more than a century past.
</p>
<p>
In the progress of time the notions of infinite quantity
introduced by Kepler, Cavalieri, and others, into mathematics,
became familiar to geometers, who perceived the
immense value of the improvement, and saw that, by due
care in its application, there was no risk of its leading
into error. Dr Wallis, in the year 1655, gave an admirable
specimen of this new analysis in his <i>Arithmetic of
Infinites</i> ; a work which contained the first traces of the
algebraic analysis applied to the quadrature of curvilineal
spaces. Pursuing the views of Cavalieri, he reduced the
problem of finding the areas of curves to the summation
of the powers of an arithmetical series, consisting of an
infinite number of terms, or rather the ratio of the mean
of all the terms to the last term. He also showed by the
same principles, that certain curve lines might be <i>rectified</i>,
or that straight lines might be found to which they were
exactly equal ; a remark that was shortly afterwards verified
by William Neil, a young mathematician of that period,
who, at the age of nineteen, showed that the length
of the semicubical parabola might be found in finite terms.
This was the first curve that was rectified, and the second
was the cycloid, a discovery due to Sir Christopher
Wren.
</p>
<p>
Thus the principles of the fluxional calculus were at this
period coming gradually into view. Their importance was
seen and understood, and in substance, although without
an appropriate notation, they were employed in extending
the dominion of geometry ; it might therefore be supposed
that in the course of time they would have been
gradually formed into a system, just in the way the science
of algebra advanced from the rude form it had when
first introduced into Italy, to that degree of compactness
and perfection which it acquired by the successive improvements
of Vieta, Harriot, and Descartes. But, in
the case of the fluxional calculus, a happy combination
of circumstances anticipated the slow operation of time.
Newton and Leibnitz, two men endowed with the highest
powers of mind, appeared nearly at the same time in the field
of discovery. The genius of each shone with resplendent
lustre, even amidst the blaze of intellect which enlightened
the latter period of the seventeenth century, and which
has rendered it for ever memorable in the annals of human

knowledge. They both turned their attention to this
branch of mathematical science, and, as is now generally
admitted, each, independently of the other, collected the
undigested principles into a system, and, by a powerful
effort, performed at once what the united labour of ordinary
minds would have hardly accomplished in a century.
In ascribing to each of these great men the full honour
due to the merit of the invention of the calculus, it
is proper to add, that this is a question which at one
time divided the opinions of the learned world, and gave
rise to a controversy which was agitated with great keenness
for almost a whole century. There never could be
any doubt as to Newton being the inventor of the calculus
of fluxions. He has been acknowledged by all to have
been the inventor, and the first inventor ; but the question
strongly contested has been, whether Leibnitz, without
knowing what had been done by Newton, invented
his differential calculus by the force of his own mind, or
borrowed it from the fluxional calculus, with which at
bottom it is identical.
</p>
<p>
In the course of this controversy it was clearly established
by the British mathematicians, who almost to a
man ranged themselves on the side of their illustrious
countryman, that, as far back as the year 1669, Newton,
then in his twenty-sixth year, and a fellow of Trinity College,
communicated to Dr Barrow a tract, entitled <i>De
Analysi per Æquationes Numero Terminorum Infinitas</i>.
In this manuscript the method of fluxions was first indicated ;
and rules deduced from it given for the quadrature
of curves, and various other matters to which the
calculus is applicable, were distinctly specified. From this
tract, which was sent by Dr Barrow to Collins, the secretary
of the Royal Society, it is established beyond all
doubt that Newton was then in full possession of his method ;
and indeed it is certain from other evidence that
he must have had it as far back as 1666. The important
discoveries made by Newton were communicated without
reserve by the secretaries of the Royal Society to mathematicians
on the Continent, as well as to those in Britain.
In this way it might be generally known that Newton
possessed a most valuable instrument of research, by which
he had been led to these results, although its nature was
too obscurely indicated to give any assistance in divining
its precise form.
</p>
<p>
Leibnitz appears to have been later than Newton in beginning
his career of discovery in the mathematics. In
the year 1672, being then in London, he communicated to
some members of the Royal Society what he supposed to
be discoveries relating to the differences of numbers. It
was, however, shown to him that the same subject had
been discussed long before, by Mouton, a French geometer.
He then appears for the first time to have turned
his attention to infinite series. Afterwards, on his return
to Germany in 1674, he announced to Mr Oldenburgh,
then secretary of the Royal Society of London, that he
possessed very general analytical methods, by which he
had found theorems of great importance relating to the
quadrature of the circle, by means of series. In answer,
the secretary informed him that Newton and James Gregory
had also discovered methods which gave the quadrature of
curves, and which extended to the circle.
</p>
<p>
In the year 1676 Newton addressed a letter to the secretary
of the Royal Society, which was made known to
Leibnitz. This was the first direct communication between
these two great men. It contained the binomial theorem,
which Newton had known in the year 1669, and a
variety of other matters relating to infinite series and
quadratures ; but nothing directly relating to the method
of fluxions. At this time Newton entertained no
jealousy of Leibnitz, for he speaks of him in the letter

with great respect. In a second letter Newton explained
at his request the way in which he had found the binomial
theorem, and he adverted also to his own calculus, explaining
the purposes to which it could be applied, but concealing
its nature under the form of an anagram of transposed
letters, which was expressed thus, <i>6accdae13eff713l9n4o
49rr4s9t12vx</i>. It is not easy to see what certain information
Leibnitz could draw from this assemblage of characters ;
yet such was the effect of national prejudice in biassing
the minds of the British mathematicians, that Raphson,
in his <i>History of Fluxions</i>, a work dedicated to the
Royal Society of London, expressly asserts that Leibnitz
deciphered the anagram, and found it to be this sentence,
<i>Data equations fluentes quotcunque quantitates involvente invenire
fluxiones, et vice versa</i>. “Having any given equation
involving never so many flowing quantities, to find
the fluxions, and <i>vice versa</i>” We believe there was not
the least ground for this assertion ; and from such a
specimen of want of candour, it is easy to infer that there
was very little chance of Leibnitz getting justice done him
by the English mathematicians.
</p>
<p>
In the month of June 1677 Leibnitz sent to Mr Oldenburgh,
to be communicated to Newton, a letter containing
the first essays of a method which extended to all
that could be done by that of Newton. The death of
Oldenburgh, which happened soon afterwards, put an end
to the correspondence, and it was not until the year 1684
that Leibnitz made his discovery public, it being then inserted
in the Leipsic Acts ; so that whilst Newton’s claim
to the priority of the discovery must be admitted by all,
it is not less certain that Leibnitz was the first to give the
full benefit of the calculus to the world ; for Newton’s Method
of Fluxions only became generally known in the year
1687, by the publication of his <i>Philosophiæ Naturalis
Principia</i>.
</p>
<p>
It is certain that Leibnitz enjoyed unchallenged for fifteen
years the honour of being the inventor of his calculus ;
even Newton himself rendered him that justice in
the first edition of his immortal work. Subsequently, however,
a foreign mathematician, Fatio de Duillier, piqued,
it is said, by having been omitted in an enumeration of
eminent geometers by Leibnitz, declared, in a treatise on
the line of shortest descent, printed at London in 1699,
that he was obliged by the undeniable evidence of things
to acknowledge Newton not only as the first, but as by
many years the first inventor of this calculus ; from whom,
whether Leibnitz, the second inventor, borrowed any thing
or not, he would rather they who had seen Newton’s letters
and other manuscripts should judge than himself.
</p>
<p>
The insinuation contained in this passage of Fatio’s book
could not but be very offensive to Leibnitz, who inserted
an animated reply in the Leipsic Acts of 1700, and complained
to the Royal Society of London of the injustice
done him ; and here the affair rested for a time : but it
was revived some years afterwards. When Newton’s treatise
on the quadrature of curves, and his enumeration of
lines of the third order, was published, the Leipsic journalists
gave an unfavourable review of the work. Amongst
other things, after a brief exposition of the nature of fluxions,
they added, that Newton uses and has always used
fluxions for the differences of Leibnitz, just as Fabri had
substituted in his synopsis of geometry motion instead of
the indivisibles of Cavalieri. This most unjust accusation
excited great indignation in the minds of the British mathematicians,
one of whom, Keill, Savilian professor of astronomy
at Oxford, in a paper inserted in the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i> of the year 1708, affirmed that Newton
was the first inventor of the calculus, and that Leibnitz,
in publishing it in the Leipsic Acts, had merely changed
the name and the notation. Leibnitz, thus directly charged

with having taken his calculus from that of Newton,
addressed a letter to Mr, afterwards Sir Hans Sloane, the
secretary of the Royal Society, in which he required that
Keill should retract his accusation. Keill however refused
to do this, and in answer addressed a letter to the secretary,
in which he professed to show, not only that Newton had
preceded Leibnitz in the invention, but that he had given
so many indications of his calculus that its nature might
easily be understood by any man of ordinary understanding.
This letter was sent to Leibnitz, who addressed a second
letter to the Royal Society, requiring that they should
stop these reproaches of Keill, saying that he was too
young a man to know what had passed between him and
Newton.
</p>
<p>
The society, thus appealed to as a judge, appointed a
committee to examine the old letters, papers, and documents
which had passed between the mathematicians on
the subject. The report of this committee does not appear
altogether satisfactory. “We take the proper question
to be,” say the reporters, “not who invented this or
that method, but who was the first inventor of the method ;
and we believe those who have reputed Leibnitz the first
inventor, knew little or nothing of the correspondence between
Mr Collins and Mr Oldenburg long before, nor of
Mr Newton having that method about fifteen years before
Mr Leibnitz began to publish his in the <i>Acta Eruditorum</i>
of Leipsic ; for which reason we reckon Mr Newton
the first inventor, and are of opinion that Mr Keill, in
asserting the same, has been nowise injurious to Mr Leibnitz.”
This declares nothing on the only point about which
there could be any doubt, namely, whether Leibnitz had
formed his calculus entirely by the power of his own genius,
or had availed himself of a knowledge of Newton’s
invention. The judgment satisfied neither party. Keill
wished to establish against Leibnitz the charge of plagiarism,
but was disappointed ; and Leibnitz found in the decision
grounds of complaint against the Royal Society. In
a communication to the Abbé Conti, a Venetian nobleman
and a common friend of his and Newton, then in England,
he accused the English nation of desiring to be considered
as almost the only inventors. He said it did not
appear, as had been well observed by Bernoulli, that Newton
possessed before him the infinitesimal characteristic
and algorithm, although it would have been easy to have
found it if he had been so disposed, just as it would have
been easy for Apollonius to have discovered the theory of
curve lines of Descartes. He complained that his opponents
had attacked his candour by forced and unfounded
interpretations of his words. The question was the calculus
of differences, and his opponents made it turn entirely
upon series, where Newton had no difficulty in
going before him. He maintained that he had found for
himself a general method for series, and that he had no
need of Newton’s method of extractions. There were
other grounds of complaint, such as, that only extracts
from letters had been given in the <i>Commercium Epistolicum</i>,
whereas the entire letters should have been published.
Throughout the whole, which is a postscript to a letter,
he manifests much chagrin ; and he concludes with proposing
this problem, intended, he says, to feel the pulse of
the English analysts : To find a line which shall cut perpendicularly
all curves of a determinate species, and of
the same kind ; for example, all hyperbolas, which shall
have the same vertex and centre. This he desires the
abbé to propose as from himself, or a friend.
</p>
<p>
In the abbé’s reply to this letter he informed Leibnitz
that he had delayed writing until he could at the same
time send the answer which Newton had given to his
postscript. He tells him that he had read the <i>Commercium
Epistolicum</i>, and the originals of the letters which it

contained, and, on the whole, he inferred that, setting
aside matters foreign to the dispute, the only question at
issue was, whether Newton had found the Calculus of Infinitesimals,
or Fluxions, before, or after him? The abbé
says, you published it first, it is true ; but you admit that
Newton allowed much to transpire in the letters which he
wrote to Oldenburgh and others. This has been proved
at length in the <i>Commercium</i> and its extract ; what is your
answer? This is what the public requires, to form a correct
opinion on the matter. The abbé further informs
Leibnitz that his friends believe he ought to give an answer,
if not to Keill, at least to Newton himself, who, in
the letter which the abbé had received from him to be
communicated to Leibnitz, had challenged him in express
terms. In a spirit of friendship and good sense, he further
adds, that he wishes to see a good understanding between
them, that the public will profit but little by their
disputes, and that the additions to knowledge which they
prevent are a pure loss to posterity. He moreover tells
him that the king, George I., had desired to be informed
of all that had passed between Newton and him. From
this we may judge what an interest was excited in the
public mind by a dispute which, even at this day, few
could perfectly understand. The answer which Leibnitz
gave to the abbé’s friendly advice was, that he had put his
letters, and Newton’s, with his own answers to them, into
the hands of Mr Remond at Paris, with a view to have
a neutral and impartial opinion as to the matters in dispute.
The whole were then to be submitted to the Abbé
Varignon and other members of the Royal Academy of
Sciences, and afterwards sent to England. In his answers
he disavowed the sense which the English mathematicians
had extracted from the assertion of the Leipsic
journalists, namely, that Newton employed and always had
employed fluxions for the differentials of Leibnitz, which
they understood to mean that Newton had availed himself
of Leibnitz’s method, only substituting fluxions for
differentials. It was from this passage that the English
had declared Leibnitz to be the aggressor, in having abetted
an attack of Newton ; but Leibnitz declared the English
interpretation to be full of malignity towards him,
and that the sentence in the <i>Leipsic Acts (Pro differentiis
Leibnitianis D. Newtonus adhibet semperque adhibuit fluxiones)</i>,
meant that Newton had employed fluxions after
having seen his differences, and also before he had seen
them.
</p>
<p>
We believe enough has been detailed to show that, besides
a desire to arrive at truth, there was infused into
this controversy the jealousy of two rivals for the glory
of a great discovery ; and, in addition, the spirit of partizanship
of their respective admirers, and that natural
feeling which induces men of different countries to exalt
their own nation, although sometimes at the expense of
their neighbours. It is not wonderful, then, that at the
time this controversy was at its height, men were greatly
divided in their opinions.
</p>
<p>
It is now impossible to obtain absolute certainty as to
the question, whether Leibnitz derived any aid from the
discoveries previously made by Newton, which, to a certain
extent, were made known to the scientific world. It
may therefore be some satisfaction, in the want of perfect
evidence, to have the judgment of Montucla, the historian
of the mathematics, on this subject. “In regard to
the principle of fluxions,” says he, “there are only three
places of the <i>Commercium Epistolicum</i> which treat of
it with sufficient clearness to prove that Newton had
found it before Leibnitz, but I believe too obscurely to
take from him the merit of the discovery. One of
these is a letter from Newton to Oldenburgh, who had remarked
to him that Slusius and Gregory had found a very

simple method of tangent. Newton answered that he
conjectured what it was, and he gave an example, which
is in effect the same thing as these two geometers had
found. He added that it was but a particular case, or
rather a corollary to a method much more general, by
which tangents to all sorts of curves, whether geometrical
or mechanical, might be found without laborious calculation.
He repeated the same thing, without explaining
himself further, in his second letter, which has been
already mentioned, and he concealed the principle under
transposed letters. The only writing in which Newton
had allowed any thing of his method to transpire
<i>Analysis per Equationes numero Terminorum infinitas</i>, He
there briefly and obscurely reveals his principle of fluxions.
It cannot be denied that the principle and method were
there indicated ; but it is not certain that Leibnitz had
ever seen the passage. His adversaries have never said
that it had been communicated to him by letter, they
have merely thrown out a suspicion that Collins might
have communicated it to him in his second journey to
London. Indeed the suspicion is not altogether void of
probability, inasmuch as Leibnitz admitted that in his interview
with the secretary he had seen a part of his epistolary
correspondence. I believe, however, that it would
be rash to pronounce upon this. There might have been
grounds for suspicion if Leibnitz had merely given a few
essays of his new calculus ; but when we consider the
improvements he made, as appears by the number of
pieces he contributed to the <i>Leipsic Acts</i>, it seems probable
that he owed his calculus to his own genius, and his
efforts to divine the nature of a method by which Newton
had made so many fine discoveries. This is the more
probable, as from the method of tangents of Barrow to
the differential calculus, the step is not too great to have
been made by a power of mind of which Leibnitz had
given so many proofs.”
</p>
<p>
If it had been true, as the British mathematicians alleged,
that Leibnitz had taken his calculus from that of
Newton, it would have been a very remarkable circumstance
that such a long period should have elapsed between
his first putting forth his pretensions to the honour
of the invention, and the denial of Newton and his friends.
This is a thing uncommon in the history of contested
claims to discovery, when both the claimants are alive
and all the facts known. It is also remarkable that Newton,
while in the prime of life, did not of his own accord
bring forward a charge of plagiarism against his contemporary.
On the contrary, in the first edition of his <i>Principia</i>,
which appeared in 1687, he expressly admitted
Leibnitz’s claim ; and this admission is found even in the
edition of the <i>Principia</i> published in 1713. It is now
well known, that before the period of the controversy between
Newton and Leibnitz, the mind of the former had at
one time been in a state which rendered him unfit to draw
correct conclusions from the ordinary incidents of life ;
witness his letters to Mr Pepys and Mr Locke in September
1693 (Brewster’s <i>Life of Newton</i>). At this time he
seems to have laboured under great bodily indisposition,
from which he afterwards in appearance recovered ; indeed
it may be doubted whether his temper was so equal
and mild in the latter period of his life as has been represented
by his biographers. A collection of letters
which passed between Flamsteed the astronomer and
Abraham Sharp the celebrated calculator, which have
lately come into the possession of the Astronomical Society
of London, prove that Newton, in conjunction with
Halley, opposed Flamsteed in the publication of his <i>Historia
Cælestis</i>, a work of the highest merit, and the result
of the labour of his life, with a pertinacity of purpose
which is by no means an amiable trait in his character.

It is certain that Newton entertained towards Leibnitz
a very different feeling at one period of his life, from
that which he in the end evinced. In the edition of the
<i>Principia</i> 1713, and those which preceded it, he says,
“Ten years ago, in a correspondence with Mr Leibnitz,
I informed him that I had a method of determining maxima
and minima, of drawing tangents, and resolving similar
problems, which applied alike to rational and irrational
terms, but concealed it under transposed letters.
He answered that he had found a like method, which he
communicated, and which differed from mine only in the
terms and the signs, and in the way of conceiving quantities
to be generated.” This concession was liberal, and
worthy of Newton. However, in the edition of 1726, he
retracted this act of justice, haying struck out the passage,
as Montucla assures us, with his own hand. The
historian of the mathematics, however, finds an excuse
for this harshness in the treatment which Newton had
received from Leibnitz's friends.
</p>
<p>
The circumstance of the calculus having had two distinct
origins, had the inconvenient effect of giving it two
different forms and names. Newton at different times
used different notations before he finally adopted that
which has been followed by the English mathematicians.
Leibnitz and his followers employed one somewhat different ;
and each sect pertinaciously adhered to the example
set by its leader. There was a still greater difference
in the view which each party took of quantity, and the
way in which it may be generated. Newton conceived
geometrical magnitudes to be generated by continued
motion, a line by a point in motion, a surface by a moving
line, a solid by a moving surface, an angle by a line turning
about a point, and so on. It is evident, that by assuming
geometrical quantities as the representatives of
time, force, and whatever can be expressed by number,
these can be conceived to increase or decrease according
to the same laws as their geometrical representatives.
His calculus therefore consisted of two parts :
</p>
<p>
<i>1st</i>, Supposing two quantities to have a given relation
to each other (for example, the one to be always equal
to the square of the other), and the rate of increase of
one of them at any instant of time to be known ; to find
the rate of increase of the other at the same instant.
These rates of increase were called the <i>fluxions</i> of the
quantities ; and the rules for their determination constituted
the <i>direct method of fluxions</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>2d</i>, The second part was the reverse problem, in which
the relation between the rates of increase of two quantities
which depended the one on the other, being given, it was
required to discover the relation of the quantities. This
was the inverse method.
</p>
<p>
Leibnitz at first supposed quantity to increase by the
addition of some indefinite portion of a quantity of the
same kind, and his <i>differentials</i> were quantities proportional
to the instantaneous changes in the greatness of
the quantities thus generated. He afterwards found it
shorter to introduce directly these instantaneous changes
into his calculus under the name of infinitely little differences
(<i>infiniment petites</i>). These however he did not regard
as absolute zeros, but only as not comparable to finite
magnitudes. His calculus had, like Newton's, two parts,
the <i>differential calculus</i>, which gave rules for deducing
the relation of the differentials of quantities from that of
the quantities themselves, and the <i>integral calculus</i>, which
resolved the reverse problem, or discovered the relation
of the quantities when the relation of their differentials
was known. This corresponded to the inverse method of
fluxions, as the differential calculus corresponded to the
direct method.
</p>
<p>
There is this distinction, then, between the two methods :
Newton’s fluxions are any finite quantities which have to
each other the ratio of the velocities, or degree of quickness
with which the quantities are generated. The differentials
of Leibnitz are infinitely small quantities, a creation
of the mind more removed from ordinary apprehension
than the finite representatives of fluxions. This distinction
has often been urged in favour of the superiority
of Newton's calculus. On the other hand, Newton has
introduced time into his calculus. Now this is an element
foreign to geometry, and belonging to mechanics, a
quite distinct branch of science. The metaphysical distinctions
between the two forms of the calculus have had
but little influence on its progress. Whichever of the two
forms is chosen, the rules are the same ; and so also are
the difficulties to be overcome.
</p>
<p>
Some time elapsed before the newly invented calculus
was actively employed. At length Leibnitz, to rouse the
attention of geometers, proposed in 1687 this problem :
To determine the curve along which a heavy body must
descend, so as to approach by equal distances in equal
times to a horizontal plane. Huygens was the first to
resolve the problem. He showed what was the nature of
the curve ; but he did not give his demonstration. James
Bernoulli also resolved the problem by the differential
calculus, and published his analysis in the Leipsic Acts.
His younger brother John united himself in a close friendship
with Leibnitz, and continued throughout life his
coadjutor and staunch defender. He made the calculus
known in France, where he resided for a time, and gave
lessons to the Marquis de l’Hôpital. Part of these form
the <i>Analyse des infiniment Petits</i>, a work which bears the
name of the marquis, with but a slight acknowledgment
in the preface of the share which his preceptor had in its
composition. Indeed it was almost entirely his ; and of
this injury Bernoulli complained justly, but privately, in
his correspondence with Leibnitz. The remaining lessons,
which teach the integral calculus, are given in the collection
of Bernoulli’s works, published in 1742. The whole
form an excellent exposition of the principles of the calculus,
and contain some of its finest applications.
</p>
<p>
The continental mathematicians who were remarkable
for their skill in the differential calculus were at first few
in number. They might be nearly all included in the
names of Leibnitz himself, James and John Bernoulli, De
l’Hôpital, and Varignon. They were, however, remarkably
active, particularly the Bernoullis, whose writings have
contributed powerfully to its advancement.
</p>
<p>
The inventor of the fluxional calculus seems to have
taken but little interest in its extension. His treatise on
quadratures did not appear till 1706 ; and his work on
fluxions was not published in his life time, but appeared
in 1736, nine years after his death. He had however
fully availed himself of its power in the composition of
his <i>Principia</i>, without revealing to the full extent the nature
of the instrument with which he wrought, but establishing
the truth of his propositions by synthetic demonstration,
after the manner of the ancient geometers. Probably
this was done in deference to the taste of that time ;
for a contemporary writer, Hermann, in following his example
in the composition of his <i>Phoronomia</i>, assigned to
Leibnitz as a reason, that the geometrical method was
likely to be better understood than the analytical in Italy.
This way of proceeding is now, however, disused by the
best writers, and replaced by the more legitimate and undisguised
use of the calculus.
</p>
<p>
The extensive views which the new calculus opened up,
afforded the means of resolving problems which had baffled
the skill of the earlier mathematicians, and suggested
many new ones, which without its aid would have been
quite intractable. The cycloid and the catenary, curves
which had eluded the penetrating mind of Galileo, were
more fully comprehended ; many new ones were suggested,
and the cultivators of the calculus challenged each other
to an investigation of their properties. There is an elegant
class of problems which relate to the greatest and
least values of quantities. Some of these, called problems
of <i>maxima</i> and <i>minima</i>, can be resolved by the ordinary
geometry and algebra ; but there is a class which lies
beyond the dominion of these, and to it belongs the solid of
least resistance, the curve of swiftest descent, and, in general,
the problems called <i>isoperimetrical</i>, one of the simplest
of which is to find the nature of the line which, being
given in length, shall comprehend the greatest possible
space. These formed the subject of a warm but honourable
contest between the two Bernoullis, brothers ; and
their investigation laid the foundations of that branch of
the calculus, the highest, which has been formed into a
theory by the labours of Euler and Lagrange, under the
name of the <i>Calculus of Variations</i>.
</p>
<p>
Among the early cultivators of the calculus in Britain
we may reckon Cotes, the friend of Newton, who died at
the early age of thirty-four (his <i>Harmonia Mensurarum</i>,
and other writings, indicate a genius of the highest order),
De Moivre, Taylor, Craig, David Gregory, and Stirling. It
must, however, be confessed, that the continental school
in the course of time advanced before that of Britain, as
well in the number of its disciples, as in their high mathematical
genius and the importance of their discoveries.
John Bernoulli had two sons, Nicolas and Daniel, who rivalled
their father’s skill in the applications of the calculus ;
and these had as condisciples Hermann and Euler.
This last mathematician has carried the subject to a point
of perfection far beyond what it had attained in the hands
of those that had gone before him.
</p>
<p>
Amongst the means by which the improvement of the
calculus has been promoted, we may reckon the problems
which passed between the British and continental mathematicians
as challenges to each other, in answering which
Newton himself condescended sometimes to enter the
lists. The doctrine of infinite series, a branch of the mathematics
of English origin, gives powerful aid to the
calculus in its greatest difficulties ; but, legitimately, its
assistance ought not to be called in if the problem admit
of being resolved in finite terms. The English sometimes
failed in the observance of this most proper condition of
a good solution, and thus gave rise to reproaches from
their opponents, which in at least one instance were not
unjustly incurred by Newton himself. In the course of
this warfare, Keill, the champion of the English, proposed
as a challenge to John Bernoulli, to determine the nature
of the curve which a projectile describes in a medium resisting
as the square of the velocity. Bernoulli soon resolved
the problem, not only in the case proposed, but also
when the resistance was as any power whatever of the
velocity. He then proposed to put his solution into the
hands of some confidential person in London, provided
that Keill would deliver his solution to the same person.
Keill, however, had upon trial not been able to resolve
the problem, and therefore preserved a profound silence,
and made himself, by his boasting and failure, quite ridiculous.
The triumph of Bernoulli was complete, and he
did not miss the opportunity of bestowing severe castigation
on his humbled adversary, recollecting, we may suppose,
the treatment which his deceased and lamented
friend Leibnitz had received from him and his friends.
</p>
<p>
As another proof of the spirit and rivalry of the supporters
of the two analytical theories, we may mention
that Brooke Taylor proposed a problem in the integral
calculus to all geometers not English, and sent it to
Mr Montmort to be communicated to the foreign geometers.

Notwithstanding the general terms of the challenge, it
was well understood to be particularly aimed at John
Bernoulli who in return offered to wager fifty Louis that
he would resolve the problem, and to stake fifty more
that he would propose a problem which he himself could
resolve, but which Taylor could not. The English mathematician
did not think it prudent to accept the offered
condition. Indeed it was a complaint against the English
geometers, that although they made no scruple of trying
to puzzle foreigners with difficulties, they rarely responded
to the counter challenges proposed to themselves.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps there never was a considerable invention or
discovery which had not to encounter opposition ; sometimes
from the slowness with which the human mind
yields to the force of truth when opposed to long-received
opinions, and sometimes from less excusable causes, such
as mistaken or interested views, or mere jealousy excited
by the fame of the inventor. The new calculus had in the
very outset its opponents, such as the Abbé de Catelan, a
zealous Cartesian, who declared that it would be better
to extend the principles of the Cartesian geometry than
to seek for new methods ; and this was said in the preface
of a book composed on the principles, somewhat disguised,
of the very calculus of which he was an opponent. It
had another adversary in Nieuwentiit, a man who had
written some tolerable works on morality and religion, but
who had but small pretensions to be regarded as a geometer.
Catelan was satisfactorily answered by De l’Hôpital,
as was Nieuwentiit by Leibnitz, and afterwards by
Bernoulli and Hermann, who proved that this adversary
of the calculus really did not know what he opposed.
</p>
<p>
The calculus had a more formidable enemy in M. Kobe,
a skilful algebraist and indefatigable calculator, but a man
full of confidence in his own notions, rash in forming his
opinions, and jealous of the inventions of others. He attacked
the certainty of its principles, and he attempted
to show that its conclusions were at variance with those
obtained by methods previously known, which were acknowledged
to be correct. His attack was repelled by
Varignon, who completely obviated the objections to the
truth of the principles, and further showed that the supposed
discrepancy between its conclusions and those obtained
by other methods, were mistakes he had committed
from haste and inadvertence. These disputes occupied
the French Academy a considerable part of the
year 1701. The members were chiefly geometers considerably
advanced in years, who had been long accustomed
to other methods, and were therefore not much disposed
to receive new doctrines. Some took no part in the
dispute, yet were not sorry to see a storm raised against
a theory for which they had no great liking, and took no
means to allay it ; others, more under the influence of
their passions and prejudices, yielded to these, and declared
open war against it. In this state of things the
best course was supposed to be that of hearing all which
could be said for and against the calculus. The academy
was long involved in the dispute. Rolle brought forward
objection upon objection ; and although Varignon continually
obviated them, yet the former always claimed the
victory. In the end the dispute degenerated into a real
quarrel, and commissioners were appointed to decide on it.
These were Pere Gouye, MM. Cassini and de la Hire,
who, however, pronounced no judgment ; but the public
opinion, or at least the opinion of geometers, was in favour
of Varignon. The first controversy thus ended, or at least
was suspended, for want of a decision from the commission ;
but Rolle, the champion of the opponent of the calculus,
soon renewed hostilities. Its defence was next taken up
by M. Saurin. The ground of attack was the indefinite
form which the calculus gives for the subtangent of a curve

at the point where two branches intersect each other,
and which in this case is expressed by the fraction \(0 \over 0\)
Saurin’s answer was satisfactory ; but Rolle, intrenched in
masses of calculation, obstinately maintained the combat.
The academy was again appealed to. The Abbé Bignon,
who conducted its affairs, undertook to decide the
controversy, with the assistance of MM. Gallois and De la
Hire, two judges by no means favourable to Saurin. They
gave no absolute judgment ; but recommended to Rolle
to conform more strictly to the rules of the academy,
and to Saurin to forgive the proceedings of his adversary.
Rolle suffered in the estimation of competent judges ; he,
however, afterwards did justice to the calculus, by acknowledging
that he had done wrong in opposing it, and admitting
that he had been urged forward by the instigation of
malevolent persons, one of whom was the Abbé Gallois ;
and his demise in 1707 accordingly put an end to the controversy.
</p>
<p>
In England the Newtonian calculus had to sustain an
attack on its principles from a writer of first-rate talents,
Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne. The circumstances which led
to it are curious. Mr Addison had given the bishop an
account of the behaviour of their common friend, Dr Garth,
in his last illness, which was highly unpleasing to these
two advocates of revealed religion ; for when Addison
began to discourse with Garth on a future state, “Surely,”
said the latter, “I have no reason to believe these
trifles, when my friend Dr Halley, who has dealt so much
in demonstration, has assured me that the doctrines of
Christianity are incomprehensible, and religion itself an imposture.”
The bishop therefore took up arms against Haley
and in the year 1734 addressed to him, as an infidel,
a discourse called The Analyst, the object of which was to
prove that mathematicians acted inconsistently in objecting
to mysteries in faith, seeing that they did not hesitate
to admit much greater mysteries, and even falsehoods,
in their own science ; and he chose the principles
of the doctrine of Fluxions, as laid down by Newton and
adopted by his followers, to prove the truth of his proposition.
It may be supposed that so able a writer would
not fail to make an impression on the public mind. But
the mathematicians were not slow in coming forward in
defence of the doctrines of their chief. In the same year
came out a tract with this title : “Geometry No Friend to
Infidelity, or a Defence of Sir I. Newton and the British
Mathematicians, by Philalethes Cantabrigiensis,” supposed
to be Dr Jurin. As usual the attack was renewed, and
again repelled by the same hand. Other defences of Newton
appeared, one of the best of which was from the pen of
Benjamin Robins ; it was entitled A Discourse concerning
the Nature and Certainty of Sir Isaac Newton's Method of
Fluxions, and of Prime and Ultimate Ratios. But the most
important result of this controversy was A Treatise on fluxions
from the pen of Colin Maclaurin, professor of mathematics
in the university of Edinburgh, printed in 1742.
This defence of the principles of Newton’s views, expressly
intended to obviate all objections, is quite satisfactory.
The treatise is indeed considerably prolix ; but this was a
consequence of the circumstances in which it was composed.
It however contains a great deal more than a mere
theory of fluxions. We have in it some of the finest applications
of analysis to the principal problems which had
been agitated amongst geometers from the invention of the
calculus to the time in which the work appeared.
</p>
<p>
By the middle of the century the calculus proceeded
with a rapid march of improvement. Euler in 1744 greatly
enriched it by his solution of the Isoperimetric Problem
(<i>Solutio problematis isoperimetrici latissimo sensu accepti</i>), a
theory which he afterwards wrought up into the Calculus

of Variations, and which has been still further improved
by Lagrange. Brooke Taylor, by his <i>Methodus Incrementorum</i>,
had extended the foundations, and even proceeded
a great way in the structure, of a kindred calculus, that of
finite differences. Stirling had followed in the same path
in his <i>Methodus Differentialis</i> ; and Euler had opened a new
field for discovery in the calculus of partial differences, in
which D’Alembert followed his steps, and carried the subject
further. The same period abounded in good writers.
In this country Demoivre, Simpson, Landen, and Waring,
stand among the foremost in the list for the originality of
their views ; on the continent Ricatti, Clairaut, Fontaine,
and others, followed in the train of Euler and the Bernoullis.
</p>
<p>
It is a curious fact in the history of mathematics, that
there are instances of ladies who have applied their talents
to its study and improvement with much success. Hypatia,
the daughter of the ancient geometer Theon, is one
notable instance. Unfortunately we have no vestiges of
her writings by which we might form an estimate of her
proficiency in a science which at first sight seems not to have
many attractions for the female mind. We have another
instance in an Italian lady, Maria Gaetana Agnesi, who
was actually professor of mathematics in the University of
Bologna in the year 1748 ; and how well she was qualified
for the office appears from her Analytical Institutions, a
work of great excellence on algebra, the theory of curve
lines, and the differential calculus, composed for the
instruction of the youth of Italy. This work is so excellent,
that Bossut, a French mathematician of great eminence,
translated the part on the differential calculus into
French, and incorporated it with his Course of Mathematics,
as the best treatise he could find on the subject.
There is also an English translation by the Rev. John
Colson, Lucasian professor of mathematics in the university
of Cambridge. Her countryman Frisi, a most competent
judge, mentions her in enumerating the mathematicians
of Italy, and bestows great praise on her work, calling it
<i>opus nitidissimum, ingeniosissirmnn, et maximum certe opus
quod hactenus ex feminæ alicuius?? calamo prodierit</i>. At
the present time we have another admirable instance of a
lady who has surmounted the difficulties of the calculus.
Mrs Somerville, in her work entitled <i>Mechanism of the
Heavens</i>, London, 1831, has enriched English literature
with a treatise on physical astronomy, in which the different
branches of the calculus are combined with the most
refined theories of mechanics. Her book does her infinite
credit, and indeed is highly honourable to the whole
female sex.
</p>
<p>
Geometers have differed in opinion as to the best way
of working up the principles of the calculus into a system.
Newton, as has already been stated, employed the
theory of motion as the means of connecting its doctrines
with the principles of the ordinary algebraic analysis.
Leibnitz, again, with the same view, conceived quantity
as passing from one degree of magnitude to another by
the continual accretion of infinitely small parts. The
mind finds no great difficulty in distinctly apprehending
the subject in its simplest state either way. Objections
have, however, been taken to both, and attempts made
to substitute a better. Euler considered the infinitely
small quantities of Leibnitz as absolute zeros, that have
to each other ratios derived from those of the vanishing
quantities which they replace. D’Alembert proposed to
make the basis of the calculus the consideration of the
ratios of the limits of the quantities. An English mathematician,
Landen, has substituted for the Newtonian method
of fluxions another purely analytical. His views are
contained in a work entitled The Residual Analysis, a
new branch of the Algebraic Art, by John Landen, 1764.
Lastly, Lagrange, in the Memoirs of the Berlin Academy

for 1772, proposed to make the calculus altogether independent
of the consideration of infinity, and to rest on
principles purely analytical, thus connecting it with the
doctrines of the ordinary algebra. He has since realised
and extended his views in his <i>Théorie des Fonctions Analytiques</i>,
also in his <i>Leçons sur les Calcul des Fonctions</i> ;
works which, from their excellence and the celebrity of
their author, have formed a new era in the history of the
calculus.
</p>
<p>
The twofold origin of the calculus, besides placing its
principles on different foundations, gave it also two different
forms of notation ; and in this state it continued during
the whole of the eighteenth century, to the great inconvenience
of mathematical students, and, we may add, to
the hindrance of the progress of science. A change,
however, has taken place within the last twenty years ;
during that period some British geometers, imbued with
the mathematics of the continent, adopted also its notation
in preference to that of the followers of Newton, and
employed it publicly in their researches. This spirit of innovation
in time took possession of the minds of the junior
members of the university of Cambridge, and now we may
say that it has completely supplanted the native notation.
We have retained the name of Fluxions, because, from the
changes which have taken place in the way of treating
the subject since the days of Leibnitz and Newton, it
seems to be as proper as the term differential. It is otherwise
with the notation. This is consecrated by its having
been employed in the writings of Euler, D’Alembert, Lagrange,
and other great masters in mathematical science ;
and besides, it has advantages over the other in point of
symmetry and compactness, and the established reputation
of a whole century of useful service. It is true, the
late illustrious Lagrange laid it aside in his attempt above
mentioned to new-model the calculus ; but subsequent
writers, in extracting what was excellent from his works,
have in general invested his views with the ordinary notation
of the continent. In the following treatise we shall
conform to this beneficial alteration.

The preceding catalogue contains the names of the principal
improvers and cultivators of the calculus, from its first
invention to the present time (1855). However, it does not
contain all their writings ; to have enumerated these would
have extended the catalogue to too great a length. Almost
all the improvements of the calculus were first given in the
form of academical memoirs, from which they have been
drawn, and incorporated into the systems that have from
time to time been published. The great repertories in
which it is contained are the writings of Newton, Cotes,
Demoivre, the Bernouillis, Maclaurin, Simpson, Euler,
D’Alembert, Lagrange, Legendre, La Place, Monge,
Poisson, Gauss, Ampère, Ivory, &c. From these have
been constructed the treatises of De l’Hôpital, Bougainville,
Le Seur and Jacquier, Cousin, and others, which
were the most complete at the different periods when they
appeared. At this time the most extensive treatise is the
second edition of Lacroix, which came out between 1810 and
1819. In the present century there have been published
in France treatises by Gamier, Du Bourguet, Bouchariat,
Cauchy, and others which we have not seen. In Britain,
we have had treatises by Woodhouse, Dealtry, Lardner,
Jephson, Young, Thomson, and others. The university of
Cambridge, long infertile, now teems with treatises on the
subject. There are, besides, treatises on the calculus in
courses of mathematics, such as the Elementi d’Algebra of
Paoli, the Cours des Mathématiques of Bezout, a like work
by Francœur, and a Course of Mathematics for the Naval
and Military Academy by Dr Rutherford and others.
There have also been works constructed for the benefit of
students, which may be used with any treatise on the subject ;
such as the excellent collection of examples by Peacock,

Herschel, and Babbage, which was intended as an
accompaniment to an English translation of an abridgment
of Lacroix’s treatise ; and the integral tables of Hirsch,
which have been translated from the original German into
English. And since then Hind’s Exercises on the Differential
Calculus, and Gregory’s Exercises in the Differential
and Integral Calculus.

There is a branch of the calculus of great interest, which
of late has engaged, and will probably long engage, the
attention of mathematicians ; we mean the subject of <i>Elliptic
Transcendents</i>. This theory originated in the discovery
of a very remarkable property of the ellipse and hyperbola
by Fagnani, an Italian mathematician, who first showed
that arcs of these curves can be assigned, of which the
difference is expressible in finite algebraic terms. Legendre,
who gave this name to functions represented by the
integrals of this form, discovered several of their very
remarkable properties, and deduced from them the means of
calculating their approximate values. For all the interesting
but lengthy and minute details of these important investigations,
we must refer those who feel desirous of investigating
them thoroughly, to the following list of treatises
on the subject. The student, however, should be aware
that the term fluxion is very seldom used by the best scientific
scholars of the present time. The reader of such works
should also be aware that not only is the notation of Newton
different from that of Leibnitz, but that which the
latter calls <i>difference</i> the former calls <i>fluxion</i>, because he
supposes that the co-ordinates, and in general the quantities
augmented indefinitely and gradually were produced by a
flowing or fluxion of infinitely small parts.

<h1>
PART I. DIRECT METHOD OF FLUXIONS, OR DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
</h1>
<p>
1. In the application of algebra to the theory of curve
lines, some of the quantities under consideration are conceived
as having always the same magnitude as the parameter
of a parabola, and the axes of an ellipse or hyperbola ;
others again are indefinite in respect of magnitude,
and may have any number of particular values ; such are
the co-ordinates at any point in a curve. This difference
in the nature of the quantities has equally place in various
theories of the pure and mixed mathematics, and it naturally
suggests the division of all quantities into two
kinds ; namely, such as are constant, and such as are variable.
</p>
<p>
A constant quantity is that which is supposed to have
always the same value. A variable quantity, again, is
that which may change its value by increasing or decreasing,
so that in passing from one degree of magnitude to
another it will have had in succession every possible intermediate
magnitude.
</p>
<p>
Thus, in a circle, the radius is a constant quantity, and
any arc of the circle, also its cosine, sine, tangent, secant,
&c. are variable quantities. In the ellipse, the axes or
semiaxes are considered as constant ; and the co-ordinates
to any point in the curve, and in general any lines or
spaces or angles which in the same ellipse admit of different
values, are variable. So again in the parabola, the
parameter is constant, and the co-ordinates to any point
in the curve, also any arc of the curve, and the space contained
by that arc and the co-ordinates, are to be regarded
as variable.
</p>
<p>
In what follows, we shall in general call constant quantities
simply <i>constants</i>, and variable quantities <i>variables</i>.
</p>
<p>
It is usual to denote constants by the letters \(a, b, c, \text{&c.}\)
towards the beginning of the alphabet, and variables by
the letters \(x, y, z, \text{&c.}\) towards the end.
</p>

<p>
2. One quantity is said to be a <i>function</i> of another when
they are so related that the latter being supposed to
change its value, the former also changes its value. Thus,
in geometry, the radius of a circle being constant, the
cosine, the sine, the tangent, the secant, &c. are functions
of the arc. On the other hand, the arc may be considered
as a function of any one of these quantities. In mechanics,
the force by which a body is urged forward, the
space it has passed over, and its velocity at every instant,
may all be regarded as functions of?? the time.
</p>
<p>
In this algebraic expression,
	\[y = {a + x \over a - x},\]
in which \(a\) is a constant and \(x\) a variable, the quantity \(y\)
is regarded as a function of \(x\), which is called the <i>independent</i>
variable. Here \(y\) is expressed by \(x\) ; but by resolving
the equation, \(x\) may be expressed by \(y\) thus :
	\[x = {a(y-1) \over y + 1} ;\]
the quantity \(x\) is now a function of \(y\). In either case, the
constants \(a\) and \(1\) are not considered. In these examples,
	\[u = a + b x^2 + c x^3,\]
	\[u = \sqrt{(a^2 + bx + x^2)},\]
	\[u = {a + \sqrt{bx} \over c + x^2},\]
\(u\) is a function of \(x\).
</p>
<p>
A quantity may be a function of several independent
variable quantities. Thus, in the expression
	\[u = a x^2 + b xy + c y^2,\]
\(u\) is a function of the independent variables \(x\) and \(y\).
</p>
<p>
The variety of forms of functions of a variable is endless.
They may, however, be resolved into a few elementary
functions such as these,
	\[x^n, a^x, \log x, \sin x, \cos x.\]
The first of these, \(x^n\), in which \(n\) is constant, and all that
can be formed from it by a finite number of the elementary

operations of algebra, are called <i>algebraic</i> functions ;
for example, this,
	\[u = a x^3 + {b x^2 - c^x \over \sqrt{a^2 + x^2}},\]
which is formed by addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and the extraction of the square root. These
two, \(a^x, \log x\), which cannot be expressed by a finite number
of terms composed of powers of \(x\), are called <i>transcendental</i>
functions, and the remaining two, \(\sin x, \cos x\),
and such as may be formed from them, viz. \(\tan x, \sec x,
\text{&c.}\) are called <i>trigonometrical</i>, also <i>angular</i> and <i>circular</i>
functions.
</p>
<p>
In the last example, the value of the function \(u\) may be
immediately found, if the value of \(x\) be known. Such
functions are called <i>explicit</i>. There are functions, however,
which require to be separated from the variable by
the resolution of equations, or other means, before their
value can be found ; as in this example,
	\[ux = {u + x \over u - x},\]
in which \(u\) is supposed to be a function of \(x\). In this
case, before the value of \(u\), corresponding to a given value
of \(x\), can be found, a quadratic equation must be resolved.
Such a function is called an <i>implicit</i> function of \(x\). On
the other hand, \(x\) is an implicit function of \(u\). By the
resolution of an equation we find
	\[u = {1 \over 2}\left\{x + {1 \over x} + {\sqrt{x^4+6x^2+1} \over x}\right\} ;\]
\(u\) is now an explicit function of \(x\).
</p>
<p>
The early algebraists indicated the square root of a
quantity by placing the letter \(r\) before it ; thus \(rx\) meant
the square root of \(x\). The letter was afterwards changed
into the sign √, and the square root of \(x\) was conveniently
expressed thus, \(\sqrt x\). In like manner, it is convenient
to have a symbol which shall express generally a function
of a variable, and accordingly it is now usual to express
any function of a variable \(x\) by the symbol \(fx\) or \(f(x)\) ;
also by \(Fx\), or \(\varphi x\). Here the letters \(f\) or \(F\), or \(\varphi\), are considered 
merely as the abbreviation of the word <i>function</i>,
and not as a co-efficient to the letter \(x\). In this way we
include all these expressions,
	\[u = x^n, u = a^x, u = \log x, u = \cos x, u = \sin x,\]
in one general expression, viz. \(u = fx\), or \(u = f(x)\).
</p>
<p>
When a function depends on two variable quantities \(x,
y\), which are independent of each other, such as this expression,
	\[u = a x^2 + b xy + c y^2,\]
we shall express it thus,
	\[u = f(x, y).\]
Here we take no notice of the constant quantity \(a, b, c\).
A like notation may be applied when three independent
variables enter a function.
</p>

<p>
3. The manner in which we propose to treat this subject
requires that the reader should distinctly understand what
is meant by a <i>limit</i> to the value of a variable function, or
a variable ratio. In the elements of geometry it is shown
that the area of a circle is less than that of any regular
polygon described about it ; and that the greater the number
of sides of the polygon, the more nearly is its area
equal to that of the circle ; so that any space being given,
however small, a polygon may be described about the
circle, which shall differ from it by less than that space.
Suppose now a series of polygons to be described about a
circle, each having the number of its sides greater than
that which preceded it, the double for example. These
will approach continually to an equality with the circle as

a <i>limit</i>, which the series, however far continued, can never
absolutely reach in respect of magnitude, but from which
some term, and all that follow it, may differ by less than
any space assignable.
</p>
<p>
In like manner, the circle is the limit of the area of all
regular polygons inscribed in it ; and the circumference
of the circle is the limit of the perimeters of regular polygons
described in it or about it.
</p>
<p>
In our article <span style="font-variant : small-caps ;">Algebra</span> (sect. 266) it has been shown,
that, putting a for an arc of a circle, the fraction \(a \over \sin a\)
always greater than an unit, but that \(a \over \tan a\) is always less ;
farther, that the arc being supposed to decrease continually,
these fractions approach to each other, and may differ by
less than any assignable quantity ; therefore unity, which
is always between them, is their common limit. Hence it
appears, that of these three quantities, an arc, its sine, and
its tangent, the limit of the ratio of any two is that of
equality. In the same article it has been shown that the
arc a is the limit of the fractions \(n \tan{a \over n}\) and \(n \sin{a \over n}\),
supposing the number \(n\) to be increased continually.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
4. Since the value of a function depends essentially on
that of the variable, which is its basis, any change in
the value of the latter will produce a corresponding change
in the value of the former. 
</p>
<p>
Fust, let the function be \(u = x\), and let us suppose
that the variable changes its value, being increased by
a quantity \(h\), and thereby becoming \(x + h\) ; let \(u'\) denote
the corresponding value of \(u\), so that we have
	\[u' = (x+h)^2 = x^2 + 2xh + h^2 = u + 2xh + h^2 ;\]
hence \(u' - u = 2xh + h^2\).
It thus appears that, \(h\) denoting the increment of the variable
\(x\), the corresponding increment of the function, viz.
\(u' = u\), is \(2xh + h^2\).
</p>
<p>
The algebraic expression for a ratio is a fraction whose
numerator is the antecedent, and denominator the consequent.
In the present case, the ratio of the increment of
the function to that of its variable is
	\[{u' - u \over h} = 2x + h.\]
</p>
<p>
As another example, let the function be \(u = x^3\) ; then,
supposing, as before, that the variable \(x\) is increased by
the quantity \(h\), and, putting \(u'\) for the new value of the
function, we have
	\[u' = (x+h)^3 \]
	\[{u' - u \over h} = 3x^2 + 3xh + h^2.\]
In this case we see that when \(x\) has increased to \(x + h\)
the function \(u\) has become
	\[u + 3x^2h + 3xh^2 + h^3,\]
having received the increment \(3x^2h + 3xh^2 + h^3\), a quantity
composed of the integer powers of \(h\). Farther, it appears
that the expression for the ratio of the increments is
	\[3x^2 + 3xh + h^2,\]
of which the first term \(3x^2\) is entirely independent of the
value of \(h\), the increment of \(x\).
</p>
<p>
When the function is \(u = x^4\), we have, putting, as in
the former examples, \(h\) for the increment of the variable,
and \(u'\) for the new value of the function,
	\[u' = u + 4x^3h + 6x^2h^2 + 4xh^3 + h^4,\]
	\[{u' - u \over h} = 4x^3 + 6x^2h + 4xh^2 + h^3,\]
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
<i>If \(u\) be any function of a variable \(x\), and if in that
function \(x\) be supposed to change its value and become
\(x + h\) ; the corresponding new value of the function will be
	\[u' = u + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 +, \text{&c.}\]
and the ratio of the increments of the function and its variable,
	\[{u' - u \over u} = p + q h + r h^2 +, \text{&c.} ;\]
an expression which, when \(h\) is supposed to decrease continually,
has for its limit the first term \(p\) ; and this limit will
be different for different functions, there being such a connection
between the function and its limit, that the one may
be found, from the other.</i>
</p>
<p>
This property of the increments of a function and its
variable suggests an important and extensive analytical
theory, which will consist of two parts.
</p>
<p>
I. Any function of a variable quantity being proposed,
to determine the limit of the ratio of the corresponding
increments of the function and its variable.
</p>
<p>
II. On the other hand, having given the ratio of the
increments, to find the function from which it has been
derived.
</p>
<p>
These two inquiries constitute at bottom the <i>Direct and
Inverse Method of Fluxions of Newton</i>, the <i>Differential
and Integral Calculus</i> of Leibnitz, and the <i>Theory of
Functions</i> of Lagrange. Our present subject is the direct
method of fluxions, or its equivalent, the differential calculus.
</p>

<p>
5. We have seen (4), that by the transition of a function,
for example, \(u = x^2\), from one state of magnitude to
another, by a change in the magnitude of its variable \(x\), it
acquires the new value \(u' = u + 2xh + h^2\). The <i>whole difference</i>
\(u’ - u\) between its new and first values is \(2xh + h^2\).
It is the first term of this difference, viz. \(2xh\), that constitutes
what is called the <i>differential</i> of the function from which it
has been derived ; and the determination of this first term
for any function is the object of this first part of our calculus.
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
In conformity with this definition, the differential of the
variable a : itself will be its increment \(h\), which, because of
its use in generating the differential of the function, has
been designated by a peculiar symbol, viz. dx : here the
letter \(d\) is to be understood as a characteristic, not as a
co-efficient. The letter \(d\) is also prefixed to the symbol
for a function to denote its differential. Thus, supposing
\(u = x^2\) we have \(du = 2x dx\), an expression which means
that the differential of the function mis equal to the differential
of the variable multiplied by \(2x\) as a co-efficient ; so
also if \(m = x^3\) the equation \(du = 3x^2dx\) means that the
differential of \(u\) is equal to the differential of a : multiplied
by \(3x^2\).
</p>

<p>
6. Since, when \(u = a^2\), then \(du = 2x dx\), this last expression
may otherwise stand thus, \({du \over dx} = 2x\) ; under this form
\(2x\) is the co-efficient in the expression for the differential
of \(u\), and it is on that account called the <i>differential co-efficient</i>
of the function \(u\) or \(x^2\). In like manner, when
\(u = x^3\), then \(du = 3x^2dx\) and \({du \over dx} = 3x^2\) ; in this case \(3x^2\)
is the differential co-efficient of the function \(u = a x^3\). The
general symbol for the differential co-efficient of any function
\(u\) is \(du \over dx\), and the new value of \(u\) being \(u + p h + q h^2
+, \text{&c.}\) we have \({du \over dx} = p\), where \(p\) is some function of \(x\),
which depends on the form of the function \(u\), and is deducible
from it when its form is known.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
7. The rule given in last article, for determining the differential
of a function, supposes that we have methods,
by which any function may be expanded into a series of
terms, into each of which some integer power of the increment
\(h\) enters only as a factor. It is sufficient for our
purpose, however, if we can find that term of the series
which contains the simple power of \(h\) ; and this can in
general be found easier than the general development,

which indeed maybe the very thing to be investigated by
the calculus. Now we have seen (4) that the co-efficient
of this term is the expression for the limit of the ratio of
the corresponding increments of a function and its variable,
and the same quantity is the differential co-efficient of
the function (6), therefore the determination of the differential
of a function is the same thing as the determination
of the limit of the ratio of the increments.
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
According to this view of the subject, the differential
calculus is the finding of the ratios of the simultaneous increments
of a function and of the variable on which it depends.
</p>
<p>
The process of calculation by which the differential of
any function \(u\) is found, may be regarded as a particular
operation performed on quantity, analogous to the elementary
operations of algebra ; and it may, like these, be
distinguished by a particular name accordingly. The result
of the process being the <i>differential</i>, the process itself
is called <i>differentiation</i>, and to perform the process on a
function is to <i>differentiate</i> the function.
</p>

<p>
8. It is material to observe, that the limit of the ratio of
the increments of a function and its variable are the very,
same, whichever of the two be considered as a function of
the other. Thus, \(u\) being a function of \(x\), when \(x\) becomes
\(x + h\), \(u\) becomes \(u + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 +, \text{&c. } p, q, r,
\text{&c.}\) being functions of \(x\), deducible from the function \(u\).

</p>

<p>
9. It is easy to see that two equal functions must have
equal differentials ; for whatever be the value of the variable

on which they depend, it must necessarily happen
that the respective changes they receive in consequence
of the change which is attributed to the variable must also
be equal. Thus, if \(u\) and \(v\) be two functions, such, that
\(u = v\), whatever may be the value of \(x\) ; and if, when \(x\)
becomes \(x + h\), then \(u\) becomes \(u'\), and \(v\) becomes \(v'\), we
shall have \(u' = v'\), and \(u' - u = v' - v\), and
	\[{u' - u \over h} = {v' - v \over h}.\]
If then \(p\) and \(q\) denote the limits of these ratios, \(p = q\)
and \(p dx = q dx\), that is, \(du = dv\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
10. The differential of any function of a variable \(x\) maybe
found by the general methods indicated in article 6 ; but
it is convenient to have rules adapted to particular cases.
</p>
<p>
Let \(r\) and \(s\) be two functions of a variable \(x\). It is proposed
to investigate a rule for finding the differential of
\(u = rs\), their product.
</p>

<p>
11. Since, when \(u = rs\), we have \(du = sdr + rds\), it
follows that
	\[{du \over u} = {dr \over r} + {ds \over s}.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
In general, <i>If a function be the product of any number of
functions of a variable, its differential is the sum of the products
obtained by multiplying the differential of each by the
product of all the other functions.</i>
</p>
<p>
The same rule may also be briefly expressed in symbols,
thus : whatever be the number of functions \(r, s, t, v\),
	\[d(rstv) = rstv \left\{{dr \over r}+{ds \over s}+{dt \over t}+{dv \over v}\right\}.\]
</p>
<p>
12. To find the differential of a fraction whose numerator
and denominator are functions of a variable \(x\) ; let \(u =
{r \over s}\), then \(r = us\), and
	\[dr = u ds + s du,\]
and, putting for \(u\) its value \({r \over s}\),
	\[dr = {r ds \over s} + s du ;\]
therefore,
	\[du = {s dr - r ds \over s^2}.\]
</p>
<p>
Hence we have this rule : <i>To find the differential of a
fraction ; from the differential of the numerator multiplied
by the denominator subtract the differential of the denominator
multiplied by the numerator, and divide by the square of
the denominator.</i>
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
13. We shall next investigate a rule for the differential
of any power of a function \(y\), which may be either itself
an independent variable, or else some function of another
variable.
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
Hence this rule : <i>To differentiate any power of a function,
multiply it by the exponent, diminish the exponent by
an unit, and multiply by the differential of the variable</i>.
</p>
<p>
If the function have a co-efficient, the differential must
be multiplied by that co-efficient. Thus
	\[d(a x^n) = na x^{n-1}dx.\]
</p>
<p>
The determination of the differential of a power of a
variable might have been shortened by assuming the truth
of the binomial theorem, as found in our article <span style="font-variant : small-caps ;">Algebra</span>,
art. 160, 161. That theorem however may be derived
from the differential calculus, and we shall give its
investigation as one of its applications.
</p>
<p>
It frequently happens that the differential of \(\sqrt y = y^{1 \over 2}\),
the square root of a function, is to be found ; therefore a
rule for that case will be convenient. By the general
rule for a power,
	\[d(\sqrt y = y^{1 \over 2}) = {1 \over 2}y^{{1 \over 2}-1}dy = {1 \over 2}y^{-1{1 \over 2}}dy,\]
	\[\text{that is, }d(\sqrt y) = {dy \over 2\sqrt y}.\]
</p>
<p>
Hence it appears that <i>the differential of the square root
of a function is the differential of the function divided by
twice its square root</i>.
</p>

<p>
14. Let \(y\) be a function of a variable \(x\), and let \(u\) be a
function of \(y\) ; it is proposed to investigate a rule for
finding the differential of \(u\) relatively to \(x\).
</p>
<p>
Suppose \(x\) to change its value and become \(x + h\), then \(y\)
becomes \(y' = y + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 +, \text{&c.}\) ; or, putting \(p h
+ q h^2 + r h^3 +, \text{&c.} = h\), \(y\) becomes \(y + h\), then \(u\) becomes
\(u' = u + p'k + q'k^2 + r'k^3 + \text{&c.}\) ; here \(p', q', r', \text{&c.}\) denote
certain functions of \(y\), which are independent of \(k\) 
and also of \(h\). Hence, by substituting for \(k\) in this last
series, its value \(p h + q h^2 + \text{&c.}\), it appears that when \(x\) 
becomes \(x + h\), \(u\) becomes
	\[u' = u + p'ph + (p'q+q'p^2)h^2 + \text{&c.}\]
and hence
	\[{u' - u \over h} = p'p + (p'q+q'p^2)h + \text{&c.}\]
Suppose now \(h\) to decrease continually, we have
	\[\text{limit of }{u' - u \over h} = p'p.\]
</p>
<p>
Now, \(y\) being a function of \(x\), \(p = {dy \over dx}\), and \(u\) being considered
as a function of \(x\), then
	\[{du \over dx} = \text{limit }{u'-u \over h} = p'p.\]
Hence it follows that
	\[{du \over dx} = {du \over dy} \times {dy \over dx},\]
and
	\[du = \left({du \over dy} \times {dy \over dx}\right)dx.\]
</p>
<p>
Hence this rule : To find, relatively to \(x\), the differential
of \(u\), a function of \(y\), the quantity \(y\) being a function
of \(x\), <i>Find the differential co-efficient of \(u\) considered as
a function of \(y\) only, and the differential co-efficient of \(y\)
considered as a function of \(x\) ; multiply the product of these
co-efficients by the differential of \(x\), and the result is the differential
of \(u\)</i>.
</p>
<p>
It has been found that
	\[{du \over dy} \times {dy \over dx} = {du \over dx} .??\]
Now if we suppose that \(u = x\), then this expression becomes
	\[{dx \over dy} \times {dy \over dx} = {dx \over dx} = 1 ;\]
and hence it appears that
	\[{dx \over dy} = {1 \over {dy \over dx}}.\]
</p>
<p>
This shows that the differential co-efficient of \(x\) considered
as a function of \(y\), is the reciprocal of the differential
co-efficient of \(y\) considered as a function of \(x\), a conclusion
which may also be deduced from art. 8.
</p>

<p>
15. Let \(v, y, z\) be functions of a variable \(x\), and let it
be proposed to find the differential of
	\[u = a + bv + cy - ez,\]
where \(a, b, c, e\), denote constants.
Let us suppose that when \(x\) becomes \(x + h\), then
	\[v \text{ becomes } v + p h + q h^2 +, \text{c&.}\]
	\[y \text{ becomes } y + p'h + q'h^2 +, \text{c&.}\]
	\[z \text{ becomes } z + p''h + q''h^2 +, \text{c&.}\]
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
From this it appears that <i>the differential of a function
made up of others simply by addition and subtraction is composed
in like manner of the differentials of the several terms,
each with the sign of the function from which it was derived ;
the differential of a constant being reckoned</i> \(= 0\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
16. These rules are sufficient for the differentiation of
any explicit algebraic function, and we shall now give
examples.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
17. The subjects which are to follow require the application
of the binomial theorem, we shall therefore give
its investigation, as the first application of the calculus.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
18. In the investigation of the binomial theorem we
have employed a principle of analysis of continual use in
the calculus, namely, that in such an equation as this
(called an <i>Identical Equation</i>),
</p>

<p>
19. We come now to the investigation of the differentials
of transcendental functions of a variable, and begin
with the exponential function \(u = a^x\), the exponent \(x\)
being variable, and the quantity a constant. Assuming
that when \(x\) becomes \(x + h\), \(u\) becomes \(u'\), we have
	\[u = a^x, u' = a^{x+h} = a^x a^h ;\]
therefore, \(u' - u = a^x, a^h - a^x = a^x(a^h - a)\) ;
	\[\text{and }{u' - u \over h} = a^x{a^h - 1 \over h}.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
20. To find the differential of the transcendental \(u = \log
x\), the base of the system being a. By the definition of a
logarithm (<span style="font-variant : small-caps ;">Algebra</span>, art. 165),
	\[x = a^u,\]
and, supposing that \(x\) becomes \(x + h\), and that \(u\) becomes \(u'\),
	\[x + h = a^{u'} ;\]
therefore, \(h = a^{u'} - a^u = a^u(a^{u'-u}-1) = x(a^{u'-u}-1)\) ;
and hence, making \(k = u' - u\),
	\[{k \over u' - u} = {x(a^k - 1)\over k},\]
	\[\text{and }{u' - u \over k} = {1 \over x} \cdot {k \over a^k - 1}.\]
Passing now to the limits of the two sides of the equation,
and observing (as was proved in last article) that \(k\) being
supposed to decrease continually,
	\[\text{limit of }{k \over a^k - 1} = {1 \over \ln a},\]
	\[\text{we have }{du \over dx} = {1 \over \ln a} \cdot {1 \over x}.\]
</p>
<p>
Let \(M\) denote the constant factor, viz. the reciprocal
of Napier’s logarithm of the base of the system of logarithms,
which is the modulus of the system (<span style="font-variant : small-caps ;">Algebra</span>,
art. 172), and we have
	\[du = {M dx \over x}.??\]
</p>
<p>
That is, <i>The differential of the logarithm of a number is
found by multiplying the differential of the number by the
modulus of the system and dividing by the number</i>.
</p>
<p>Note.—In Napier’s system \(M = 1\).
</p>

<p>
21. The differentials of the trigonometrical functions
\(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\) are next to be investigated.
</p>
<p>
Let \(u= \sin x\), and \(u' = \sin(x + h)\) ; then (<span style="font-variant : small-caps ;">Algebra</span>, 240),
	\[u' - u = \sin(x + h) - \sin x = 2 \cos(x + {1 \over 2}h) \sin {1 \over 2}h,\]
	\[\text{and }{u' - u \over h} = \cos(x + {1 \over 2}h){\sin{1 \over 2}h \over {1 \over 2}}.\]
</p>
<p>
Observing now that A being understood to decrease
continually until it vanish, the limit of \(\cos(x + {1 \over 2}h)\) is
\(\cos x\), and
	\[\text{the limit of }{\sin{1 \over 2}h \over {1 \over 2}} = 1\]
(<span style="font-variant : small-caps ;">Algebra</span>, 266), we have
	\[{du \over dx} = \text{limit }{u' - u \over h} = \cos x ;\]
	\[\text{and }du = dx\cos x.\]
</p>
<p>
Next let \(u = \cos x\), and \(u’ = \cos(x + h)\) we have now
	\[u' - u = \cos(x + h) - \cos x = -2\sin(x + {1 \over 2}h)\sin{1 \over 2}h ;\]
	\[{u' - u \over h} = -\sin(x + {1 \over 2}h){\sin{1 \over 2}h \over {1 \over 2}}.\]
Passing now to the limits by supposing A to decrease
continually,
	\[{du \over dx} = \text{limit }{u' - u \over h} = -\sin x ;\]
	\[\text{and }du = -dx\sin x.\]
</p>
<p>
Hence it appears that <i>The differential of the sine of an
arc is the product of the differential of the arc and its cosine ;

and that the differential of the cosine is the product of the
Method, differential of the arc and its sine with the sign - prefixed</i>.
</p>
<p>
Note.—The negative sign indicates, that while the arc
increases the cosine decreases when it is positive.
</p>
<p>
The differential of the cosine might have been found
otherwise, by regarding it as a function of the sine. Thus,
putting \(v\) for the sine, and \(y\) for the cosine ; because
\(y^2 = 1 - v^2\), by differentiating, \(y dy = -v dv\) ; now \(x\) 
being the arc, \(dv = y dx\) ; therefore \(y dy = -vy dx\), and
\(dy = -v dx\).
</p>

<p>
22. The functions \(u = \tan x, u = \cot x, \text{&c.}\) may be considered
as formed from the elementary functions \(\sin x\)
and \(\cos x\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
23. Corresponding to the direct functions
	\[u = \sin x, u = \cos x, \text{&c.}\]
there are the reverse functions,
	\[u = \text{arc}(\sin = x), u = \text{arc}(\cos = x), \text{&c.}\]
</p>
<p>
The first, viz. the arc whose sine is \(x\), is sometimes by
British writers expressed thus ; \(u = \sin^{-1}x\) ; and the second,
the arc whose cosine is \(x\), thus ; \(u = \cos^{-1}x\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
24. Having now found rules for the differentiation of
the elementary transcendentals and trigonometrical functions,
we proceed to exemplify their application to the
differentiation of complex functions.
</p>
<p>
(1.) Let \(u = \text{arc}(\sin = x) = \sin^{-1}x\) ;
then \(x = \sin u\) ; and \(dx = du\cos u = du\sqrt{1 - x^2}\) ;
	\[\text{and } du = {dx \over \sqrt{1 - x^2}}.\]
</p>
<p>
(2.) Let \(u = \text{arc}(\cos = x) = \cos^{-1}x\) ;
then \(x = \cos u\) ; and \(dx = -du\sin u = -du\sqrt{1 - x^2}\) ;
	\[\text{and } du = {-dx \over \sqrt{1 - x^2}}.\]
</p>
<p>
(3.) Let \(u = \text{arc}(\tan = x) = \tan^{-1}x\) ;
then \(x = \tan u\) ; and \(dx = du\cos u = du(1 + x^2)\) ;
	\[\text{and } du = {dx \over 1 + x^2}.\]
</p>
<p>
(4.) Let \(u = \text{arc}(\cot = x) = \cot^{-1}x\) ;
then \(x = \cot u\) ; and \(dx = -du\cos u = -du(1 + x^2)\) ;
	\[\text{and } du = {-dx \over 1 + x^2}.\]
</p>
<p>
(5.) Let \(u = \text{arc}(\sec = x) = \sec^{-1}x\) ;
then \(x = \sec u\) ; and \(dx = du\sec u \tan u = du x\sqrt{x^2 - 1}\) ;
	\[\text{and } du = {dx \over x\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}.\]
</p>
<p>
(6.) Let \(u = \text{arc}(\text{cosec} = x) = \text{cosec}^{-1}x\) ;

then, proceeding as in the foregoing examples, we find
	\[du = {-dx \over x\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}.\]
</p>

<p>
25. As examples combining logarithmic and angular
functions :
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
26. As examples of complex angular functions :
</p>
<p>
(1.) Let \(u = \tan^{-1} x\) ; that is, let \(u\) be the arc whose
tangent is \(x\), and let \(z = \cos nu \cos^n u\).
It is proposed to find the differential co-efficient \(dz \over dx\).
In the first place, \(du = {dx \over \sec^2 u} = dx \cos^2 u\),
	\[
	dz
	\begin{cases}
		= -n du(\sin nu \cos^n u + \cos nu \sin u \cos^{n-1}u) \\
		= -n du \cos^{n-1}u(\sin nu \cos u + \cos nu \sin u)\\
		= -n du \cos^{n-1}u \sin(n+1)u.\\
	\end{cases}
	\]
and \({dz \over dx} = -n\sin(n+1)u\cos^{n+1}u\).
</p>
<p>
(2.) Next, \(u\) being the same function of \(x\) as before,
let \(z = \sin nu \cos^n u\),
to find the differential co-efficient \(dz \over dx\).
In this case,
	\[
	dz
	\begin{cases}
		= n du(\cos nu \cos^n u + \sin nu \sin u \cos^{n-1}u) \\
		= n du \cos^{n-1}u(\cos nu \cos u + \sin nu \sin u)\\
		= n du \cos^{n-1}u \cos(n+1)u.\\
	\end{cases}
	\]
and \({dz \over dx} = n\cos(n+1)u\cos^{n+1}u\).

Successive Differentiations
</h2>
<p>
27. A function of a variable, when differentiated, produces
a new function, viz. its differential co-efficient. This in
its turn may be differentiated, and there will be produced
another differential co-efficient, which will stand in the
same relation to the former as that did to the original
function. By another differentiation, a third differential
co-efficient may be formed ; and so on continually, unless
some differential co-efficient come out = 0.
</p>


<h2>
Taylor's Theorem
</h2>
<p>
28. We have assumed for the foundation of the differential
calculus an important analytical principle, first particularly
recognised by Euler, viz. Let \(f(x)\) denote any
function of a variable quantity \(x\) ; if instead of \(x\) there be
substituted \(x + h\), \(h\) being any indeterminate quantity,
so that the function becomes \(f(x + h)\), this new value
may always be expanded into a series of this form,
	\[f(x) + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 +, \text{&c.},\]
in which the quantities \(p, q, \text{&c.}\) are new functions of \(x\) 
derived from the primitive function, and independent of
the indeterminate quantity \(h\).
</p>

<p>
29. The truth of this principle has been exemplified by
induction from particular cases. Lagrange has, however,
given a demonstration of it in his <i>Théorie des Fonctions</i>,
which is to the following effect :

</p>
<p>
In the first place, the development of the function
\((x + h)\) cannot contain any fractional power of A, so long
as \(x\) is entirely indeterminate. For the radicals of A can
only come from radicals in the primitive function ; and it
is manifest that the substitution of \(x + h\) instead of \(x\) can
neither increase nor diminish their number, nor change
their nature, while \(x\) and \(h\) are indeterminate. On the
other hand, by the theory of equations, every radical expression
has as many different values as there are units in
its exponent ; from which it follows, that every irrational
function has as many distinct values as there are combinations
of the different values of the radicals which it
contains. Therefore, if the development of the function
\(f(x + h)\) could contain a term of the form \(u \over h^{m \over n}\), the
function fx must necessarily be irrational, and contain a
certain number of different values, which must be the
same for its development ; but this development being
represented by the series \(f(x) + p h + q h^2 +, \text{&c.}
+ u h^{m \over n} +, \text{&c.}\) every value of the function \(f(x)\) (the
first term) might be combined with each of the \(n\) values
of the radical \(\sqrt[n]{x^m}\), so that the function \(f(x + h)\) expanded

would have more values than the same function
unexpanded, which is impossible.
</p>
<p>
This demonstration is general and rigorous so long as
\(x\) and \(h\) continue indeterminate ; but it fails if determinate
values be given to \(x\), for it may happen that these
values may destroy some radicals in the function \(f(x)\),
which may yet exist in the function \(f(x + h)\).
</p>

<p>
30. It being proved that the development of the function
cannot have any fractional powers of \(h\), it is easy to
be assured that it cannot contain negative powers. For
if among the terms one had the form \(r \over h^m\) being a positive
integer number, then, in making \(h = 0\), that term
would become infinite, and the function \((x + h)\), and of
course \(f(x)\), would in this case be infinite, which cannot
be, unless a particular value be given to \(x\). Thus it
is clearly established that the development of the function
can contain neither fractional nor negative exponents.
</p>

<p>
31. The general form of the development of the function,
viz.
	\[f(x + h) = f(x) + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 +, \text{&c.}\]
being thus ascertained, the next question is, what is the
law of relation between the original function \(f(x)\) and
the functions \(p, q, r, \text{&c.}\) which are derived from it?
We owe the discovery of this relation to a celebrated
English mathematician, Brooke Taylor, who gave it in
his <i>Methodus Incrementorum</i>, published in the year 1715
in the form of an analytical theorem, which is now called
by his name : we shall now give its investigation. The
following is that of Lagrange.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
32. We shall now give another investigation of this
important formula, which is remarkable for its brevity
and simplicity. It rests on the following analytic
principle.
</p>
<p>
<i>If \(u\) be any function whatever of \(v + z\), which relation
may be expressed thus, \(u = f(v + z)\) ; the differential co-efficient
of \(u\), found on the supposition that \(v\) is variable and \(z\)
constant, will be the very same as if it were found on the
supposition that \(z\) is variable and \(x\) constant</i>.
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>

Thus it appears that the second differential co efficient of
the function \(f(v + z)\) is the same expression, whether \(v\) 
or \(z\) be regarded as the variable ; and the reasoning may
be extended to the co-efficient of any order.
</p>

<p>
33. Supposing now \(f(x) = u\) to be any function of \(x\), and
\(f(x + h) = u'\) to be its value when \(x\) becomes \(x + h\), it
has been proved (art. 29, 30), that the expansion of \(u\) is
	\[u' = u + p h + q h^2 + r h^3 + s h^4 ;\]
and here \(p, q, r, \text{&c.}\) are functions of \(x\), into which \(x\) does
not at all enter ; while, on the other hand, \(h\) is entirely
independent of \(x\). From the identity of the function 11
and its expansion, their differentials, taken on the same
hypothesis, must be equal, whichever of the quantities \(x\)
and \(h\) be regarded as the variable. Supposing, first, \(x\)
variable and \(h\) constant, we have
	\[ {du' \over dx} = {du \over dx} + {dp \over dx}h + {dq \over dx}h^2 +
		{dr \over dx}h^3 + {ds \over dx}h^4 +, \text{&c.}\]
and next, supposing \(h\) to be variable and \(x\) constant,

<h2>
Application of Taylor's Theorem to the Development of
Functions
</h2>
<p>
We shall now give some applications of this most important
analytic formula to the development of functions.
</p>

<p>
34. Let the function \(f(x)\) be \(u = x^n\), so that \(f(x + h)
= (x + h)^n\). By successive differentiation (art. 13 and 27),
	\[{du \over dx} = n x^{n-1}, {d^2u \over dx^2} = n(n-1)x^{n-2},
		{d^3u \over dx^3} = n(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3},\]
	\[{d^4u \over dx^4} = n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)x^{n-4}, \text{&c.}\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
35. Next, let \(f(x)\) be \(u = a^x\), a variable power of the
constant quantity \(a\). Then, putting
	\[A = (a-1) - {1 \over 2}(a-1)^2 + {1 \over 3}(a-1)^3
		- {1 \over 4}(a-1)^4 +, \text{&c.}\]
By article 19,
	\[{du \over dx} = A a^x, {d^2u \over dx^2} = A^2a^x, {d^3u \over dx^3} = A^3a^x, 
		{d^4u \over dx^4} = A^4a^x, \text{&c.}\]

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
36. Let the function \(f(x)\) be \(u = \log x\) to base \(a\),
then, by article 20,
	\[{du \over dx} = {1 \over Ax}, {d^2u \over dx^2} = {-1 \over A x^2},
		{d^3u \over dx^3} = {1 \cdot 2 \over A x^3}, \]
	\[{d^4u \over dx^4} = {1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \over A x^4},
		{d^4u \over dx^4} = {1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5?? \over A x^5}, \text{&c.}\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
37. Let the function be \(fx = u = \sin x\), then
	\[{du \over dx} = +\cos x, {d^2u \over dx^2} = -\sin x, {d^3u \over dx^3} = -\cos x,
		{d^4u \over dx^4} = \sin x, \text{&c.}\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
38. Let the function be the arc whose tangent is \(x\),
that is, \(u = \tan^{-1}{x}\) ;
	\[\text{then } du = {dx \over 1 + x^2} = dx \cos^2 u \text{(art. 23)},\]
	\[\text{and } {du \over dx} = \cos u \cos u.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
If the arc \(u\) be supposed \(= 0\), then \(\sin u, \sin 2m, \text{&c.}\)
are each 0, and the powers of \(\cos u\) each \(= 1\), and the
formula becomes
	\[u = \tan u - {1 \over 3}\tan^3 u + {1 \over 5}\tan^5 u
		- {1 \over 7}\tan^7 u + \text{&c.}\]
a formula due to James Gregory. We have found this
series in a very different way (<span style="font-variant : small-caps ;">Algebra</span>, art. 270), and
have there applied it to the determination of the ratio of
the diameter to the circumference. It will be therefore
sufficient to state the result here. Let cr denote half the
circumference of a circle, of which the \(\text{rad}. = 1\), then
	\[\pi = 3 \cdot 141592653590—.\]
</p>


<h2>
Maclaurin's Theorem
</h2>
<p>
39. There is a general formula nearly related to that of
Taylor, and indeed an easy deduction from it, commonly
called <i>Maclaurin's Theorem</i>. It is given at page 610 of
the second volume of his fluxions (printed in 1742) ; but
it is proper to say, that the same formula, in substance,
was given in 1717 by Stirling, in his <i>Lineæ Tertii Ordines
Neutonianæ</i>, p. 32.
</p>
<p>
We have found that \(f(x) = u\) being any function of a
variable \(x\),

</p>
<p>
This is Maclaurin's theorem, of which we shall now
give some applications.
</p>

<p>
40. Let \(w = (a + x)^n\). The expansion of this expression
has the requisite form ; then \({du \over dx} = n(a + x)^{n-1}\),

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
41. Let \(u = a^x\). This function is also of the kind that
admits of expansion by the theorem ; the differential co-efficients
are (art. 19), putting \(A = \ln a\),
	\[{du \over dx} = A a^x, {d^2u \over dx^2} = A^2a^x,
		{d^3u \over dx^3} = A^3a^x, \text{&c.}\]
</p>

<p>
42. The formula \(u = \log x\) does not admit of being expanded
into a series of the prescribed form, for in this case
\({du \over dx} = {1 \over Ax}\) ; the supposition that \(x = 0\) makes \(u\) and \(du \over dx\),as
well as all the following differential co-efficients, infinite.

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
43. The theorem may be applied to the functions
\(u = \sin x\), and \(u = \cos x\), without the least difficulty. For
the first we have
	\[U = 0, U’ = 1, U'' = 0, U''' = -1, \text{&c.}\]
	\[\text{and }\sin x = x - {x^3 \over 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3}
		+ {x^5 \over 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5} +, \text{&c.} ;\]
for the second function
	\[U = 1, U’ = 0, U'' = -1, U''' = 0, \text{&c.}\]
	\[\text{and }\cos x = 1 - {x^2 \over 1 \cdot 2}
		+ {x^4 \over 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4}
		- {x^6 \over 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6} +, \text{&c.} ;\]
</p>

<p>
44. Let \(u\) denote the arc whose sine is \(x\) ; that is, let
\(u = \sin^{-1}x\). In this case (23),
	\[{du \over dx} = (1 - x^2)^{-{1 \over 2}},\]
	\[{d^2u \over dx^2} = x(1 - x^2)^{-{3 \over 2}},\]
	\[{d^3u \over dx^3} = (1 - x^2)^{-{3 \over 2}} + 3x^2(1 - x^2)^{-{5 \over 2}},\]
	\[{d^3u \over dx^3} = 3 3x^2(1 - x^2)^{-{5 \over 2}} + 3 5x^3(1 - x^2)^{-{7 \over 2}},\]
	\[\text{&c}.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>


<h2>
Cases in which Taylor's Theorem fails
</h2>
<p>
45. We have seen that Taylor’s theorem, viz. \(u = f(x)\)
being any function of a variable \(x\),

</p>

<p>
46. Again, let the function be \(u = {b \over (x-a)^2}\) then

</p>
<p>
If we make \(x = a\) in \({b \over (x - a + h)^2}\), the function to be
expanded, it becomes \({b \over h^2} = b h^{-2}\), an expression in which
the exponent of \(h\) is negative ; therefore this case cannot
be included in a formula which contains only positive integers
of \(h\), and hence the apparent failure of the theorem.
</p>

<p>
47. That a general formula should not express all particular
cases, was at one time regarded as a kind of paradox
in analysis. Lagrange first cleared up this point, and
showed, that when by giving particular values to \(x\), the
new state of the function contains terms of the form
\(P h^{-n}\), or \(Q h^{m \over n}\), that is, negative or fractional powers of \(h\),
then, from the very nature of the calculus, all the co-efficients
in the general development after a certain term
will become infinite. On the other hand, when a particular
value of \(x\) renders the co-efficients infinite, we may
conclude that the development in that case ought to
contain fractional or negative powers of \(h\). In such particular
cases as appear not to admit of expansion by
Taylor’s theorem, other methods deducible from the calculus
are applicable ; in general, the ordinary algebraic
methods are sufficient.
</p>


<h2>
Differentiation of Equations of two Variables
</h2>
<p>
48. We have as yet differentiated only equations in
which the variables were separated, such as this, \(y = a
+ b x + c x^2\), where \(y\) is an explicit function of \(x\). But
the equations which chiefly occur in analytical inquiries
contain for the most part the two variables combined or
mixed together ; as in this equation,
	\[y^2 - 2 mxy + x^2 - a^2 = 0.\]
If we suppose the equation resolved, so that \(y\) is expressed
in terms of \(x\) only, which gives

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
49. An equation formed in any way from two independent
variable quantities may be represented by the
general symbol
	\[f(x, y) = 0.\]
</p>
<p>
The variable \(y\) must be expressible in some way by \(x\) ;
therefore we may represent its value, however found, by
the equation \(y = X\), where \(X\) denotes an expression
made up of terms containing only \(x\) and constant quantities.
When this value of \(y\) is substituted in the equation,
it becomes
	\[f(x, X) = 0.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
50. Let us take for example the equation
	\[y^2 + x^2 = a^2, \text{or }y^2 + x^2 - a^2 = 0 \tag{1.}\]
in which a is a constant quantity ; in this case,
	\[u = y^2 + x^2 - a^2 ;\]
hence we have by differentiation
	\[{du \over dx} = 2y{dy \over dx} + 2x = 0,\]
	\[\text{and } {dy \over dx} = -{x \over y} \tag{2.}.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
51. The preceding analysis gives the following rule for

determining the differential co-efficients of \(y\), a function
of \(x\), when the relation between \(x\) and \(y\) is expressed by
an equation.
</p>
<p>
Take the differentials of the terms of the equation, considering
\(y\) as a function of \(x\), and dividing by \(dx\), the result
will be an equation which gives the value of \(\frac{dy}{dx}\)
Again, take the differentials of the terms of this equation,
considering \(y\) and \(dy \over dx\) as functions of \(x\), and the result will
be an equation involving \(d^2y \over dx^2\) and \(dy \over dx\) which, combined
with the former, serves to determine \(d^2y \over dx^2\). A third equation
may be found from this, by taking the differentials,
and considering \(y, {dy \over dx}\), and \(d^2y \over dx^2\), as functions of \(x\) and this,
combined with the other two, gives \(d^3y \over dx^3\), and so on to any
number of equations.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
52. The equations which may be deduced by differentiation
from a proposed equation are called <i>fluxional</i> or
<i>differential</i> equations, and the equation from which they
have been deduced is called the <i>primitive</i> equation. The
equation which gives the value of \(dy \over dx\) is said to be of the
<i>first order</i>, and that which involves \(d^2y \over dx^2\) is of the <i>second
order</i>, and so on for the higher orders.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
53. Differential equations of all orders hold true simultaneously
with the primitive from which they have been
derived, therefore any combination of them will also hold
true ; and whatever number of values the function \(y\) has
(in the preceding example it has two), the differential co-efficients
into which \(y\) enters will have the same number.
</p>
<p>
It has appeared (art 15) that in functions of a certain
form the constants they contain vanish from their differentials.
A like remark applies to differential equations,
Thus, if \(y^2 = ax + b\) be a primitive equation, in which
a and \(b\) are constants, the differential equation is \(2y dy
= a dx\) ; and this belongs to every particular equation
which can be formed from the primitive, by giving all
possible values to \(b\). The constant \(a\) may also be made
to disappear by putting the equation under this form,
	\[{y^2 \over x} = a + {b \over x} ;\]
for this by differentiation gives
	\[{2xy dy - y^2dx \over x^2} = {-b dx \over x^2},\]
	\[\text{and }2xy dy - (y^2 - b)dx = 0 ; \text{or }
		{dy \over dx} = {y^2 - b \over 2xy}.??\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
54. Any number of constants whatever may be made
to disappear by repeating the process of differentiation as
often as there are quantities to be eliminated ; for example,
let the equation be \(y^2 = m(a^2 - x^2)\) ; by a first differentiation
\(y{dy \over dx} = -mx\) ; taking the differentials a second

time, we get \(y{d^2y \over dx^2}+{dy^2 \over dx^2} = -m\). This value of
\(-m\) being substituted in the former equation, it becomes
	\[y{dy \over dx} - x{dy^2 \over dx^2} - xy{d^2y \over dx^2} = 0,\]
a result which is independent of both \(a\) and \(m\).
</p>


<h2>
Of Vanishing Fractions
</h2>
<p>
55. When the numerator and denominator of a fraction
are such functions that, by giving a particular value to
their variable, they both become = 0 at the same time,
the fraction is then called a <i>vanishing</i> fraction. The fraction
\(x^2 - a^2 \over x - a\) is of this kind ; for when \(x = a\), the numerator
and denominator both vanish, and the fraction takes
the form \(0 \over 0\), from which we can draw no conclusion as to
its true value, although it be evident that the fraction
has then a determinate value ; for
	\[{x^2 - a^2 \over x - a} = {(x + a)(x - a) \over x - a} = x + a ;\]
and when \(x = a\), its true value is as \(a + a = 2a\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
56. When the terms of the fraction are algebraic functions,
their greatest common measure may be found by an
elementary operation in <span style="font-variant : small-caps ;">Algebra</span> (art. 20), and the fraction
disengaged from it by division. A more simple and
general solution may, however, be obtained from the differential
calculus,
</p>
<p>
Let \(P \over Q\) denote a fraction, the terms of which are functions
of \(x\)that vanish when \(x - a\), some given quantity.
Suppose now that \(x\) becomes \(x + h\), then, by Taylor’s
theorem, the fraction will become
	\[{
	P + {dP \over dx}h + {d^2P \over dx^2}{h^2 \over 1 \cdot 2}
		 + {d^3P \over dx^3}{h^3 \over 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3} +, \text{&c.}
	\over
	Q + {dQ \over dx}h + {d^2Q \over dx^2}{h^2 \over 1 \cdot 2}
		 + {d^3Q \over dx^3}{h^3 \over 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3} +, \text{&c.}
	}.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
57. Hence we have this rule : To find the fraction \(P \over Q\) in
the particular case of \(x = a\), supposing that \(P\) and \(Q\) are
both reduced to 0 by this supposition. Divide the differential
co-efficient of the numerator by that of the denominator ;
let the result be \(P' \over Q\), in which make \(x = a\) ; then,
if this expression does not become it is the value sought ;
but if it takes the form \(0 \over 0\), treat the fraction \(P' \over Q'\) in all respects
like the original fraction, and deduce from it a new fraction
\(P'' \over Q''\), and proceed in this way until an expression be
found which does not become \(0 \over 0\) when a is put for \(x\) ; and
the first expression that is found having this property is
the value sought.
</p>

<p>
58. The rule of last article will not apply when Taylor’s
theorem fails to give the developments of the functions \(P,
Q\), in the case when \(x = a\). When this happens, we may
substitute \(a + h\) instead of \(x\) in the fraction \(P \over Q\), and expand
the numerator and denominator into ascending series,
which proceed by the powers of \(h\) ; we shall then
have
	\[
		{A h^{\alpha} + B h^{\beta} +, \text{&c.}
	\over
		A'h^{\alpha'} + B'h^{\beta'} +, \text{&c.}}
	 ;??\]
instead of the proposed fraction. If in this result we suppose
\(h = 0\), we shall have the value of the fraction \(P \over Q\)
when \(x = a\). Now there are here three cases ; viz. \(\alpha >

\alpha', \alpha = \alpha', \text{and } \alpha \lt \alpha'\).
In the first case, we may write
the expression thus :
	\[
		{A h^{\alpha-\alpha'} + B h^{\beta-\alpha} +, \text{&c.}
	\over
		A' + B'h^{\beta-\alpha'} +, \text{&c.}}
	.??\]
Under this form, it is manifest that as long as a is greater
than \(\alpha'\), the supposition of \(h = 0\) will make the fraction
equal to nothing, and that it will become \(A \over A'\) when \(\alpha = \alpha'\) ;
but when \(\alpha \lt \alpha'\), we write the expression thus :
	\[
		{A + B h^{\beta-\alpha} +, \text{&c.}
	\over
		A'h^{\alpha'-\alpha} + B'h^{\beta'-\alpha} +, \text{&c.}}
	 ;\]
and by the supposition of \(h = 0\), this result becomes infinite. In all cases the true value depends on the first
term alone of each series.
</p>

<p>
59. The following rule extends to all fractions which
can occur under the indeterminate form \(0 \over 0\).
</p>
<p>
<i>Take the first term of each of the series which express the
development of the numerator and denominator when \(x
= a + h\) ; reduce the resulting fraction to its most simple
form, and then make \(h = 0\)</i>.
</p>
<p>...</p>


Volume 3
<h2>
Of the greatest and least Values of a Function
</h2>
<p>
60. In supposing that a function changes its value, we
may assume that the variable increases continually from
0 to infinity, either positively or negatively. To get distinct
notions, it may be convenient to suppose that the
variable increases or decreases by successive equal differences.
The function however may not increase or decrease
continually along with its variable. It may first increase
to a certain magnitude, and afterwards decrease ; or it
may decrease and afterwards increase ; or it may alternately
increase and decrease several times. We may represent
the variable \(x\) by the abscissa of a curve, and the
function \(y\) by the corresponding ordinate. The curve, from

its nature, may recede continually from its axis, like the parabola
and hyperbola ; or it may first recede from and afterwards
approach to the axis, like the circle and ellipse ; or
it may be sinuous, alternately approaching and receding.
</p>
<p>
When a variable function, by a continual change in its
magnitude, first increases and afterwards decreases, there
will be one value of the function which will be greater
than those which immediately preceded it, and also greater
than those which immediately follow it. In this state
the value of the function is the greatest possible, at least
within certain limits on each side of that extreme value ;
and then it is said to be a maximum. On the other hand,
if a function, by a continual change in its value, first decreases,
until it be reduced to a certain magnitude, and
afterwards increases, it is said to be a minimum, when it
is just changing from the state of a decreasing to that of
an increasing quantity.
</p>
<p>
A variable function may have several values, each of
which will be a maximum or minimum, according to the
definition. The essential character of a maximum consists
in its being greater than the values which preceded and which
follow it ; and that of a minimum in being less than the preceding
and following values. So that as many changes as
there may be from increase to decrease, or the contrary,
so many maxima and minima there will be.
</p>

<p>
61. Before proceeding farther, it will be convenient to
establish this principle. In a series of the form

</p>

<p>
62. Let \(y\) denote any function which may become a
maximum or minimum when its variable has attained
some particular value ; then, if \(x - h\) and \(x + h\) be substituted
successively in the function instead of \(x\), the two
results must be both less than the maximum value, and
both greater than the minimum value. Denoting now the
value of the function which corresponds to \(x - h\) by \(y_1\),
and the value which corresponds to \(x + h\) by \(y_1\), we have,
by Taylor’s theorem,

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
63. On the whole, we have this rule, to determine the
maximum or minimum value of \(y\), a function of \(x\).
</p>
<p>
<i>Make the differential co-efficient \({dy \over dx} = 0\) : Find the value
of \(x\), and substitute it in \(d^2y \over dx^2\) ; and if the result be negative,
the function is a maximum ; but if it be positive, the function
is a minimum. And if it be \(= 0\), then put \({d^3y \over dx^3} = 0\), and find
\(x\), and substitute it in, and draw the same conclusions
from the signs as before, and so on</i>.
</p>
<p>
The rule for determining a maximum or minimum of a
function was first given correctly by Maclaurin, in his
Fluxions, chap. ix.
</p>

<p>
64. We shall now apply the theory to the resolution of
problems, of which there may be an endless variety, and
many highly interesting.

<h2>
Determination of Tangents to Curves
</h2>
<p>
65. Let \(HPK\) be any curve referred to an axis \(AC\) ;
and let \(AB = x\) and \(PB = y\) be the co-ordinates of any
point \(P\) in the curve ; the point A being the origin of
the abscisses. Let \(PT\), a tangent to the curve at \(P\), meet
the axis in \(T\) ; and let \(SPQ\), any straight line drawn through
\(P\), meet the curve in \(Q\) and the axis in \(S\). Draw \(QC\) perpendicular
to the axis, and \(PR\) perpendicular to \(QC\) ; and
let \(PR = BC = h\), and \(QC = y'\), the ordinate corresponding
to the absciss \(x + h\).

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
66. We shall now apply these general folmulæ to some
particular curves.
</p>
<p>Ex. 1. Let the curve be the parabola, and supposing
AC to be the axis, and A its vertex : by the nature of the
curve, putting a for the parameter, \(y^2 = ax\),

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
67. To find a formula for the subtangent and normal of
curves whose nature is expressed by a polar equation.
</p>
<p>
Let \(HPK\) be such a curve, generated by the revolution
of a variable radius \(AP\) about a given point \(A\) in \(AC\), a line
given in position. Through \(A\) draw \(AT'\) perpendicular
to \(AP\) ; let a tangent to the curve at \(P\) meet this line in
\(T'\) and the axis in \(T\) ; draw \(PQ\) perpendicular to the axis
\(AC\), and draw the normal \(PD\), meeting \(T'A\) in \(D\). Then
\(AT'\) is the subtangent and \(AD\) the subnormal. Let
\(AQ = x, PQ = y\), the revolving radius \(AP = r\), the variable
angle \(PAC = v\), and the angle \(PTA = t\). The lines
\(x, y, r\) are now to be considered as functions of the angle
\(v\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
68. In some curves the segment of the axis between the
origin of the co-ordinates and the tangent increases with
the variable \(x\), and may exceed any given line. In others
the tangent cuts the axis always at a finite distance from
the origin ; it is then an asymptote to the curve. If from
the subtangent \(QT = {dx \over dy} y\) (fig. 8) the absciss \(AQ = x\) be
subtracted, the remainder \({dx \over dy} y - x\) is the general expression
for \(AT\). Now if when \(x\) is infinite this expression is
finite, we may conclude that the curve has asymptotes ;
but if it be infinite, the curve has no asymptotes.

<h2>
Differential of the Area of a Curvilineal Space, and of the
Arc of a Curve
</h2>
<p>
69. In curve lines it is convenient to consider \(x\), one of
the co-ordinates, as an independent variable quantity ; and
any area having an arc of the curve for a boundary, also
the arc, and in general every other variable quantity connected
with the curve, as functions of that variable. If
the curve be expressed by a polar equation, the angle
which the revolving radius makes with the variable may
be taken as the independent variable, and the co-ordinates
and other variable quantities related to the curve as
functions of that angle.
</p>
<p>
We begin by investigating a formula for the area.

70. To find a formula applicable when the nature of
the curve is expressed by a polar equation, let \(B\) be the
pole, and \(PB\) the variable radius,

</p>

<p>
71. We have already found (art. 23) various expressions
for the differential of the arc of one particular curve, viz.
the circle. We shall now investigate general expressions
for the differential of the arc of any curve. For this purpose
it will be convenient to establish the following geometrical
proposition.
</p>
<p>
Let \(CPMD\) be a curve, that between the points \(P\) 
and \(M\) continually approaches to or continually recedes
from an axis \(AB\). Let \(PQ, MN\) be ordinates to the axis
at the extremities of the arc \(PM\), and \(PK, MH\) tangents
to the curve at the points \(P, M\), meeting the ordinates in
\(K\) and \(H\) : The length of the arc is always of an intermediate
magnitude between the lengths of the tangents
\(PK, MH\).
</p>
<p>
Draw the chord \(PM\), and let \(I\) be the intersection of
the tangents. It is easy to see that \(PK\), one of the tangents,
meets the parallel ordinates in an angle \(K\) more
acute than \(M\), the angle made by the chord \(PM\) and
ordinate \(MN\) ; and the other in an angle \(H\) less acute,
therefore the chord will be less than the former and
greater than the latter. Now the arc is greater than the
chord ; therefore \(MH\), the least of the tangents, is less
than the arc \(PM\).
</p>
<p>
Again, in the two triangles \(PIH, MIK\), it is evident
that the two parts \(PI, IK\), of the longest tangent, are respectively
greater than \(HI, IM\), those of the shorter ;
therefore \(PK\) is longer than the sum of \(PI\) and \(IM\) ; but
the arc \(PM\) is by an axiom of geometry less than the sum
of \(PI\) and \(IM\), therefore the tangent \(PK\) is greater than
the arc \(PM\).
</p>

<p>
72. Let A be a given point in the axis, and \(C\) in the
curve ; draw \(PE, HF\) parallel to \(AB\) ; put \(AQ = x,
AN = x', PQ = y, CP = z, CM = z'\) ; then \(PE = x' - x\),
and arc \(PM = z' - z\). Because \(PM = z' - z\) is less
than \(PK\), but greater than \(MH\), therefore

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
73. In the case of curves expressed by a polar equation,
let \(A\) be the given point about which the variable radius
\(AP\) turns ; put v for the variable angle which the line
\(AP = r\) makes with \(AB\), a line given in position ; let the
rectangular co-ordinates be \(AQ = x, PQ = y\) ; then

</p>
<p>
This formula gives the differential of an arc of a curve
in terms of the differentials of the variable radius vector,
and of the angle which it makes with the axis.
</p>

<p>
74. We shall now give a method of defining a curve by
a polar equation, which leads to a simple and elegant expression
for the differential of an arc of the curve.
Let \(CPD\) be any curve, and \(A\) a given point in \(AB\), a
line given by position ; draw a tangent \(PF\) at any point
\(P\) in the curve, and a perpendicular \(AF\) from the given

point \(A\) on the tangent ; if now we know the relation between
the perpendicular \(AF\), and the angle \(FAB\), which Method,
it makes with the line \(AB\), the length of the perpendicular
Corresponding to any given value of the angle can be
found ; thus the position of the tangent will be known ;
the calculus gives a general formula for \(PF\), the segment
of the tangent between the point of contact and its intersection
with the perpendicular ; thus the point of contact
\(P\) is known, and in this way may any number of points in
the curve be determined.
</p>

<p>
75. Let \(D\) be another point in the curve, \(DH\) a tangent,
and \(AH\) a perpendicular on the tangent, and let us put

<h2>
Generation of Curves by Evolution : Radius of Curvature :
Evolutes
</h2>
<p>
76. The method of generating curves by evolution is a
geometrical theory invented by Huygens, and given in
his </i>Horologium Oscillatorium</i>. He explained it upon geometrical
principles, for his work appeared many years
before the calculus was invented.
</p>
<p>
Let \(BHE\) be a model of a plane curve made of a solid
material, having some thickness, and let one end of a
thread \(HEC\) be fastened at a point \(B\) on the edge of the
model, and applied along its convexity, so as to coincide
with it entirely between \(B\) and \(E\), the remaining portion
\(EC\) of the thread forming a straight line touching the
curve at \(E\). Suppose now the thread to be gradually unlapped
from the curve \(BE\), keeping it always tight ; the
end \(C\) will now describe another curve \(CPD\).
</p>
<p>
All curves, in which the curvature is neither infinitely
great nor infinitely small, may be generated in this way
by the evolution of a thread from another curve.
</p>

<p>
77. The curve \(EHB\), by means of which the curve
\(CPD\) is generated, is called its Evolute ; and the curve
\(CPD\) thus generated by evolution, is called the Involute
of the other curve.
</p>
<p>
From the way in which the involute is generated from
its evolute, we may infer,
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
78. We shall now investigate general folmulæ for the
radius of curvature, and for the evolute of any curve, by
which these may be found when the nature of the curve
is known.
</p>
<p>
Let \(AB\) be the common axis of the involute \(CPD\), and
its evolute \(EHB\), and \(A\) the origin of co-ordinates ; let \(H\)
be the centre, and \(PH\) the radius of curvature at \(P\) ; and
\(H'\) the centre, and \(P'H'\) the radius of curvature of another
point \(P'\), near the former. Let the radii produced,
if necessary, meet the axis in \(N\) and \(N'\) ; and let \(O\) be the
point in which they intersect each other.

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
79. To determine the nature of the evolute \(EHB\), from
any point \(H\) in the curve draw \(HK\) perpendicular to \(AB\),
and \(HI\) perpendicular to \(PQ\) ; and assuming \(A\), the origin
of the co-ordinates of the involute also as the origin of
those of the evolute, let \(AK = \alpha, HK = \beta\) ; in the triangle
\(PHI, HI = PH \cdot \cos H = r \cos v\), and \(PI = r \sin v\),
therefore
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
In these folmulæ, and in the second and third for the
radius?? of curvature, \(x\) is regarded as the independent variable,
and \(y\) as a function of \(x\).
</p>

<p>
80. From the way in which a curve may be generated
by an evolute, we have a method of finding any number of
curves which may be rectified, that is, whose length may
be assigned in algebraic terms ; for \(PH\), the radius of the??
curvature, is the sum of the straight line \(CE\), and the arc
EH of the evolute. Now we can form innumerable curves
whose radius of curvature will be known, therefore, corresponding
to every curve whose radius of curvature can be

found and expressed in algebraic terms, there is a curve
which can be exactly rectified.
</p>

<p>
81. We shall now give examples of the application of
the formulæ.

<h2>
Contact of Curves
</h2>
<p>
82. The ancient geometers paid particular attention to
the contact of straight lines, with the few curve lines which
they considered. Apollonius even touched on the contact
of circles and the conic sections ; for he treated of
the shortest line that can be drawn from a given point in
the axis to the curve. It is only, however, since the invention
of the differential calculus that this branch of
geometry has been carried to any considerable extent.
</p>

<p>
83. The curvature of a circle being the same throughout,
it serves as the means of comparing the curvature in
different points of a curve. It is, however, easy to understand,
that in like manner we might consider the nature
of the contact of a parabola, or a curve of any kind whatever,
with a proposed curve.

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
84. Again, if there be two curves whose equations are
\(y = f(x), v = F(x)\), and which have a common ordinate
\(y = v\), and if they be such, that
	\[{dy \over dx} = {dv \over dx},
		{d^2y \over dx^2} = {d^2v \over dx^2} ;\]
then no third curve of which the equation is \(u) = \varphi(x)\),
and which has a common ordinate with the other two,
can pass between them, unless at the same time
	\[{dy \over dx} = {du \over dx},
		{d^2y \over dx^2} = {d^2u \over dx^2}.\]
</p>
<p>
This proposition is proved exactly in the same way as
that in last article, by means of Taylor’s theorem. These
are particular cases of a general proposition relating to
the contact of curves which may be stated thus : If two
curves have a common absciss and ordinate, and if the
differential co-efficients of the first order of the ordinates
be equal, no third curve passing through their intersection
can go between them, unless the differential co-efficient??
of its ordinate, corresponding to the same absciss,
be equal to the differential co-efficients of their ordinates.
And if, besides their first differential co-efficients, their
second differential co-efficients be equal, then no third
curve passing through their intersection can go between
them, unless the first and second differential co-efficients
of its ordinate be equal to the first and second differential
co-efficients of the two curves, and so on to differential
co-efficients of all orders.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the two curves meet only in the point in which
their ordinates are the same, and the equality of the differential
co-efficients merely indicates that no other curve
in which the same equality does not take place can pass
between them.
</p>
<p>
From what has been shown, it appears that the contacts
of curve lines may be distinguished into different
orders. The degree of contact in which the ordinates
and also the first differential co-efficients are equal, may
be called a <i>Contact of the first order</i> ; when, in addition to
these, the second differential co-efficients are equal, it is
a <i>Contact of the second order</i> ; and so on.
</p>

<p>
85. In illustration of this theory of contacts, let us consider
the nature of the contact of any curve \(HPK\) (see
fig. 6), with a straight line \(PT\). Let \(A\) be the common origin
of the co-ordinates. In the curve, let \(AB = x, PB = y\).
Its nature will be expressed by an equation \(y=f(x)\). In
the straight line, let \(TA = c, AB = x, PB = v, \text{angle }
PTB = \alpha\) ; the equation of the straight line is \(v = (c + x)
\tan \alpha\). The hypothesis that the curve and straight line
have a common point, gives \(y = v\) ; and the equation of
the straight line, considering that \(c\) and \(\alpha\) must be regarded
as constants, gives \({dv \over dx} = \tan \alpha\) ; now, by our theory, \({dy \over dx}
= {dv \over dx}\), therefore \({dy \over dx} = \tan \alpha\). This result coincides with
what was found in art. 65 ; and it gives the sub-tangent
\(BT = {y \over \tan \alpha} = {dx \over dy}y\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
86. Let us next consider the nature of the contact of a
circle and any curve. Let \(CPD\) be the curve, and \(C'PD'\)
a circle referred to the same axis \(AK\), in which \(A\) is the
common origin of the co-ordinates. In the curve \(CPD\)
let \(AQ = x, PQ = y\). Let \(H\) be the centre of the circle ;
draw the radius \(PH\), and produce it to meet the axis
in \(N\), and draw \(HI, HK\) perpendicular to \(PQ\) and \(AQ\).
Put \(AQ = x, PQ = v\), these being co-ordinates of \(P\) any
point in the circumference of the circle ; and put \(AK = a,
HK = \beta\), the co-ordinates of its centre ; and \(PH = r\) its
radius.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
87. From what has been shown in regard to the degrees
of contact of a straight line and circle with a curve,
it appears that these depend on the number of constants
which enter into the equation of the touching line. The
equation of a straight line contains two constants, and it
admits of one order of contact only. The equation of a
circle has three constants, and it admits of a contact of
the second order. It is easy to see that the number of
differential co-efficients that can be made equal in the two
curves will always be one less than the number of constants
in the touching curve. The equation of a parabola
is \(y = \alpha + \beta x + \gamma x^2\). This and the differential equations
which may be deduced from it serve to determine the
three constants \(\alpha + \beta x + \gamma\), and thence the parabola of equal
curvature ; but since there are only two differential co-efficients,
the parabola can have a contact of the first and

also of the second order with any curve, but no higher
Method.
order of contact. A cubic parabola, whose equation is
\(y = \alpha + \beta x + \lambda x^2 + \delta x^3\), may, however, have a contact
of the third order, because it involves four constants, and
so on.
</p>


<h2>
Development and Differentiation of Functions containing
two Variables
</h2>
<p>
88. Let \(u\) be a function of two independent variables, \(x\) 
and \(y\) ; for example, \(u = a x^2 + b xy + c y^2\), and in general
\(u = f(x, y)\). Suppose now that \(x\) changes its value, and
becomes \(x + h\), and that \(y\) becomes \(y + k\), so that \(u'\)
being the new value of the function, \(u' = f(x + h, y + k)\).
It is proposed to expand u' into a series of terms proceeding
by the integer powers of \(h\) and \(k\). In particular cases
the method of proceeding is obvious ; a general formula
may be found by Taylor’s theorem as follows.
</p>
<p>
It is easy to see that the result will be the same whether
we substitute at once \(x + h\) for \(x\), and \(y + k\) for \(y\), in the
function \(u\), and then expand it ; or, otherwise, first substitute
\(x + h\), then expand the function, according to the
powers of h, and in this first result put \(y + k\) for \(y\), and
afterwards expand it into terms proceeding by the powers
of \(k\) ; or we may reverse this process, beginning with the
expansion according to the powers of \(k\), and ending with
that proceeding by the powers of \(h\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
89. This formula proves an important theorem in the
calculus, namely, if a function \(u\) of two independent variables
\(x\) and \(y\) be twice differentiated, first, on the hypothesis
that \(x\) is variable and \(y\) constant, and then the result
on the supposition that \(y\) is variable and \(x\) constant.
And again, if the order of the differentiations be reversed,
that is, if \(y\) be made variable and \(x\) constant, and then \(x\) 
variable and \(y\) constant, the final result either way will be
the very same.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
90. Supposing \(u\) to be any function of \(x\), and that \(x\) becomes
\(x + h\), by which \(u\) becomes \(u + p h + q h^2+ \text{&c.}\), or (considering
\(h\) as the <i>differential</i> of x) \(u + p dx + q dx^2 + \text{&c}\). We
have defined the <i>differential</i> of \(u\) to be the term \(p dx\), viz. that
which contains the simple power of \(h\) or \(dx\), and called the
function \(p\), the <i>differential co-efficient</i>, representing it by \(du \over dx\).
We may now extend these definitions to \(f(x, y)\), a function
of two variables, and changing \(h\) into \(dx\) and \(k\) into
\(dy\) in the development of the function, we shall have
	\[df(x, y) = du = {du \over dx}dx + {du \over dy}dy.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
91. The manner in which the differentials of functions
which depend on more than one variable are written,
gives rise to some important remarks. The expression
\({du \over dx} = dx\) must not be confounded with du, which it might be
if \(u\) contained only the variable \(x\) ; the symbol has in
this case a particular meaning, and denotes the differential
co-efficient taken on the hypothesis of \(x\) only being
variable ; or it is the quotient of the first term of the development
of the difference taken on that supposition divided
by the increment \(dx\) ; and \({du \over dy}dy\) signifies the same with
respect to \(y\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
92. What has been explained in respect of a function
of two independent variables, will apply to a function of
any number ; thus, if \(u = f(t, x, y, z)\), then,

</p>


<h2>
Of Changing the Independent Variable
</h2>
<p>
93. Supposing \(y\) to be any function of \(x\), we have estimated
every change in the magnitude \(y\) by that of the
value of \(x\), which has been supposed to vary in any way
whatever. It is, however, sometimes convenient to reverse
the hypothesis, and consider \(x\) as a function of \(y\).
We are now to investigate general rules, by which we
may pass from the differentials of \(y\), regarded as a function
of \(x\), to those of \(x\) considered as a function of \(y\).
</p>

<p>
94. Instead of supposing that one of the two variables
\(x, y\), is a function of the other, it is sometimes convenient
to regard both as functions of a third quantity. Thus,
in geometry, supposing \(x\) and \(y\) to be the co-ordinates of
a curve, we may consider the one as a function of the
other ; or we may consider both as functions of the angle
which a tangent makes with the axis, which angle is then
the independent variable. Or \(x\) and \(y\) denoting the co-ordinates
of the path of a projectile, both may be considered
as functions of \(t\), the time of the motion.
</p>


<h2>
Of the Method of Infinitesimals
</h2>
<p>
95. The ideas which we have of infinity may be embodied
in this proposition ; A quantity is not infinite so long
as it admits of augmentation. If, therefore, in the quantity
\(x + a\), we suppose \(x\) to become infinite, then a must
be suppressed, otherwise it would be supposed that \(x\) 
might be increased by the quantity a, which is contrary
to the definition. To show the consistency of the proposition,
let there be an equation
	\[{1 \over a} + {1 \over x} = M \tag{1}\]
which being multiplied by the product \(ax\), becomes
	\[x + a = Max \tag{2}\]
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
The ratios of quantities are altogether independent of
their absolute magnitude. The halves, or any like parts
of quantities, have the same ratios as the wholes. The
symbols we employ in our reasonings are not the representatives
of absolute magnitudes, but of numbers, which
have a reference to an unit ; they therefore represent
ratios only, and the absolute magnitudes of the terms of
the ratios are never considered. The differentials of quantities
are the ratios to which the ratios of the increments
of the variables continually approach ; these increments
may have any magnitude whatever. Leibnitz supposed
them to be infinitely small quantities. Upon this hypothesis
a theory has been constructed, which, by following
certain ascertained principles, has led to the discovery of
the most recondite truths in geometry and physics.
</p>

<p>
96. The admission of infinitesimals into the mathematical
sciences, necessarily leads to a succession of different
orders of infinitesimals. In a circle the ratio of the
diameter to the chord of an arc is the same as the ratio of
the chord to the versed sine ; therefore, if the chord be infinitely
small in respect of the diameter, or an infinitesimal
of the first order, the versed sine will be infinitely small,
in respect of the chord ; and, consequently, in respect of
the diameter, will be an infinitesimal of the second order.
So also, in a series of continued proportionals, \(1, x, x^2, x^3,
\text{&c.}\) of which the first term is finite, and the second, \(x\), an
infinitesimal of the first order, the third, \(x^2\), will be of the
second order, and the fourth, \(x^3\), of the third, and so on.
Upon the same principle, the product ab of two infinitesimals,
\(a, b\) of the first order will be an infinitesimal of
the second ; for we may consider that \(1 : a = b : ab\), that
is, \(ab\) is a fourth proportional to three quantities \(1, a\), and
\(b\), of which the first is finite. In like manner, the product
of three infinitesimals of the first order, also the product
of an infinitesimal of the first and of the second order,
will be an infinitesimal of the third order.
</p>

<p>
97. When the infinitely small increments of quantities
are once taken as their differentials, the different rules
for differentiation are easily found.
</p>
<p>
Thus, if \(u = xy\) ; then \(u, x\), and \(y\) receiving the infinitely
small augments \(du, dx\), and \(dy\), we have
	\[u + du = (x + dx)(y + dy) = xy + x dy + y dx + dx dy ;\]
and, taking from these equals the equals \(u\) and xy,
	\[du = x dy + y dx + dx dy.\]
Now \(du, x dy, y dx\) are infinitesimals of the first order, and
\(dx dy\) is an infinitesimal of the second, therefore it is incomparably
smaller, and in respect of the others ought to
be rejected, so that we have simply
	\[du = x dy + y dx.\]
</p>

<p>
98. In this theory a curve is considered as a polygon of an
infinite number of sides, any one of which is the differential
of the arc, therefore the differential of the arc will
be the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, of which
the sides are the differentials of the co-ordinates ; and
these being denoted by \(x\) and \(y\), and the arc by \(z\), we have
\(dz^2 = dx^2 + dy^2\). Proceeding on the same principles, if

\(s\) denote the area of a curve, the increment of \(s\) or \(ds\) will
be \(y dx + {1 \over 2} dx dy\) ; but the second part of this, viz. \({1 \over 2} dx dy\), is
a differential of the second order, and therefore infinitely
less than y dx, which is of the first order, therefore we
have simply \(ds = y dx\), agreeing with the formula of art. 69.
</p>
<p>
In a circle, the infinitely small increments of the cosine,
the sine, and the arc form a right-angled triangle similar
to that formed by the sine, the cosine, and the radius, so
that \(x\) being put for the arc, the radius being unity,
	\[1 : \cos x = dx : d \sin x, 1 : \sin x = dx : -d \cos x,\]
hence \(d \sin x = dx \cos x\), and \(d \cos x = -x dx\).
</p>
<p>
It is equally manifest, according to the infinitesimal
theory, that the subtangent is a fourth proportional to dx
(the differential of the absciss), dy (the differential of the
ordinate), and \(y\) the ordinate ; so that, as has been shown,
art. 65,
	\[\text{subtan} = {±dy \over dx} y ;\]
the positive sign being used if the absciss and ordinate
increase together, otherwise the sign -.
</p>
<p>
The great facility which the theory of infinitesimals
gives in the applications of the calculus to the higher geometry,
and more especially to the doctrines of physics, is
a high recommendation in its favour. Indeed, whatever
view be taken of the subject, the mathematician will hardly
be restrained from taking the shortest way he can find
to the object he wishes to attain, and that is in general
by the infinitesimal calculus. Accordingly we observe
that M. Poisson, in the second edition of his <i>Traité de Mécanique</i>,
distinctly premises that he will exclusively employ
the method of <i>infiniment petits</i> throughout his work.

PART II. INVERSE METHOD OF FLUXIONS, OR INTEGRAL CALCULUS
</h1>
<p>
99. The inverse method of fluxions, or integral calculus,
treats of the analytic processes by which a function may be
found, such, that being differentiated, it shall produce a
given differential. This function has been called, by writers
on fluxions, the fluent or flowing quantity ; and by writers
on the differential calculus, the integral of the proposed
differential.
</p>
<p>
To find the integral of a differential is to <i>integrate</i> that
differential ; and the process by which the integral is found
is called <i>integration</i>.
</p>

<p>
100. When an integral is proposed, its differential may always
be found by general rules. There is however no direct
rule by which we may return from the differential to the
integral, except the obvious one of retracing the steps by
which the differential has been deduced from the integral.
When these are distinctly indicated, there is no difficulty ;
but in general the steps of calculation by which the differential
might have been deduced from an integral are
obliterated or unknown ; or the differential may not have
been a direct result of differentiation ; and then there will
be no traces to show how we may pass from it to the integral.
</p>

<p>
101. It is convenient to have a symbol by which the integral
of a differential may be indicated without regard to
its particular form : for this purpose the letter \(\int\) (the initial
letter of the word <i>sum</i>) is employed. Thus, the integral
of the differential \(X dx\) is expressed by the symbol
\(\int X dx\).
</p>

<p>
102. We have seen (art. 9) that in differentiating an
expression of the form \(X ± C\), which is the sum or difference
of a variable function and a constant quantity, the
Method, constant disappears ; therefore, reversely, in taking the
integral of any differential, the constant, \(C\), must be added
to make the integral complete. This indeterminate quantity
has been called by early English writers the <i>correction</i>
of the fluent or integral, but now it is generally called the
<i>arbitrary constant</i>. It may be written either with the sign
+ or - ; its value is to be determined, as will appear
hereafter, from the particular problem under consideration.

<h2>
Integration of Rational Functions involving one Variable
</h2>
<p>
103. The general form of a differential of the first order
of a function is X dx, where \(X\) denotes any function of a
single variable \(x\). Now this function may have various
forms, and may be rational or irrational.
</p>
<p>
The rational forms of the function may be
</p>

<p>
104. The simplest case of a rational function is \(a x^n\), the
differential of which is \(na x^{n-1}dx\) ; therefore, putting
\(m = n - 1\), so that \(n = m + 1\), we have,

105. There is a particular case to which the general
rule of last article will not immediately apply ; it is that
in which \(n = -1\) ; in that case it gives
	\[\int {a dx \over x} = \int a x^{-1}dx = {a(x^0-b^0) \over 0}
		= {a(1 - 1) \over 0} = {0 \over 0}.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
106. By the rule of art. 104 it is evident that if
	\[dy = a x^m dx + b x^n dx + c x^p dx,\]
	\[\text{then, } y = {a x^m \over m+1} + {b x^n \over n+1}
		+ {c x^p \over p+1} + C.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
107. It has been found that \(u\) and \(v\) being any functions
of a variable, \(d(uv) = u dv + v du\), therefore
	\[\int u dv = uv - \int v du.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
108. To integrate the differential
	\[dy = (ax + b)^m dx,\]
we may expand the given power, and integrate the terms
of the result separately ; otherwise, make \(z = ax + b\),
then
	\[x = {z - b \over a}, dx = {dz \over a}.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
109. We shall next consider fractional functions, and
begin with the simple case of
	\[dy = {A x^m dx \over (ax+b)^n} ;\]
making \(z = ax + b\), we find
	\[x = {z - b \over a}, dx = {dz \over a},\]
and consequently
	\[dy = {A(x-b)^m dz \over a{m+1}z^n}.\]

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
110. All differentials which are rational fractions may
be reduced to this form,
	\[{
		\left(A x^{n-1} + Bx^{n-2} + Cx^{n-3} ... + T\right)dx
	\over
		x^n + A x^{n-1} + B'x^{n-2} + ... + T'
	}.\]
</p>
<p>
The general method of integrating such a differential
consists in decomposing it into others whose denominators
are more simple, which are called <i>partial fractions</i>.
These are obtained as follows.
</p>
<p>
Assume the denominator of the proposed fraction equal
to <i>zero</i>, thus forming the equation
	\[x^n + A'x^{n-1} + B'x^{n-2}.... +T' = 0.\]
Let the roots of this equation be
	\[x = -a, x = -a', x = -a'', x = -a''', \text{&c.}\]
and supposing them all different, the first side of the
equation will be (Algebra, art. 99) the product of \(n\)
factors,
	\[x + a, x + a', x + a'', x + a''', \text{&c.}\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
111. If some of the factors of the denominator of the
proposed fraction are equal, the process will require to be
modified to suit that case. Suppose the denominator
\(x^n + A'x^{n-1} +, \text{&c.} ... + T'\) to contain a factor \((x+a)^p\),
then, for every such factor, it will be necessary to assume
a partial fraction of the form
	\[{P x^{p-1} + Q x^{p-2} +, \text{&c.} ... + Y \over (x+a)^p}.\]
</p>
<p>
This and the other partial fractions being reduced to a
common denominator, and added, and the terms of the
numerator in the result being put equal to those of the
numerator of the proposed differential, as before, as many
independent equations will be obtained as there are coefficients
to be determined.
</p>

<p>
112. It is not difficult to see that the partial fraction
suited to the case of equal factors may be transformed
into an expression of the form
	\[{N dx \over (x+a)^p} + {N' dx \over (x+a)^{p-1}} ...
		+ {N'' dx \over x+a} ;\]
therefore we may at once substitute this instead of the
equivalent single fraction. We shall now have to integrate
a series of differentials of the form
	\[{N dx \over (x+a)^p},\]
which, by making \(x + a = z\), and therefore \(dx = dz\), gives
	\[\int{N dx \over (x+a)^p} = \int{N dz \over z^p} = {N z^{-p+1} \over 1 - p}
		= {N \over (1-p)(x+a)^{p-1}}.\]
These will be all algebraical except the last, \(\int{N dx \over x+a}\),
which will involve a logarithm.
</p>

<p>
113. If there be imaginary factors, these will occur in
pairs of the form \(x+\alpha +\beta\sqrt{-1}, x+\alpha-\beta\sqrt{-1}\),

and their product will be \(x^2 + 2\alpha x + \alpha^2 + \beta^2\). In this
case the best way to proceed will be to resolve the denominator
of the proposed differential into real factors of
the first and of the second degree, which is always possible
(see Equations). If there be several pairs of these imaginary
factors, each pair the same, the denominator of
the proposed differential will have factors of the form
\(\left(x^2 + 2\alpha x + \alpha^2 + \beta^2\right)^q\). Then, for the single factor
\(x^2 + 2\alpha x + \alpha^2 + \beta^2\), we must assume, in addition to the
partial fractions, for factors of the first degree, one of this
form,
	\[{(Kx + L) dx \over x^2 + 2\alpha x + \alpha^2 + \beta^2} ;\]
and for factors of the second form, this fraction,
	\[\]
or, instead of this, a series of fractions,
	\[\]
the co-efficients to be determined, as before explained.
</p>

<p>
114. To integrate the fraction
	\[{(Kx + L) dx \over x^2 + 2\alpha x + \alpha^2 + \beta^2} ;\]

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
115. To integrate the differential
	\[{(Kx + L) dx \over \left(x^2 + 2\alpha x + \alpha^2 + \beta^2\right)^q},\]

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
116. We shall now give some examples of the integration
of differentials which are rational fractions.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
117. The method of resolving a rational fraction into Inverse
its component partial fractions, by the theory of indeterminate
co-efficients (art. 110-113), is the most elementary
of any ; it is however tedious. We shall therefore
now show how the labour may be abridged.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
118. The differential calculus may be applied to the
determination of the constants \(A, B, \text{&c.}\) Resuming the
equation \(V = (x + a) Q\), we have, by differentiation,
\({dV \over dx} = Q + {dQ \over dx}(x + a)\). Suppose that when \(x = -a\),
then \(dV \over dx\) becomes \(v’\), and, as before, that \(Q\) becomes \(q\),
the differential equation will now become \(v' = q\) ; and since
\(A = {u \over q}\), therefore also \(A = {u \over v'}\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
119. Let us now suppose, that in the fraction \(U \over V\), the
denominator \(V = (x + a)^n Q\) that is, the product of \(n\)
equal factors, and \(Q\), the product of all the remaining factors ;
so that the assumption is

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
120. In this case we may also find the numerators \(A,
B, \text{&c.}\) by the differential calculus. From the equation
of art. 119 we have
	\[U = Q
		\begin{cases}
			A + B(x+a) + C(x+a)^2 ... \\
			+ E(x+a)^{n-1} + P(x+a)^n. \\
		\end{cases}
	\]
	\[U = Q\left\{A + B(x+a) + C(x+a)^2 ... + E(x+a)^{n-1} + P(x+a)^n\right\}.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
121. Let us now suppose that the fraction to be
decomposed, has a factor of the second degree, viz.
\(x^2 + 2\alpha x + \alpha^2 + \beta^2\), which cannot be resolved into two
real factors of the first degree.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
122. In the last place, let us consider the case in which
the fraction
	\[{U \over V} = {Ax+b \over (x^2+2ax+a^2+b^2)^n}
		+ {Cx+d \over (x^2+2ax+a^2+b^2)^{n-1}} ... + {P \over Q} ;\]
and here \(V = (x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + b^2)^n Q\). We have now
	\[{U \over Q} = (Ax+B) + (Cx+d)(x^2+2ax+a^2+b^2) ...
		+ {P \over Q}(x^2+2ax+a^2+b^2)^n V.\]
</p>
<p>
This case is compounded of the two preceding, and
must be treated in the same manner. In the first place,
we substitute for \(x\), one of the roots of the equation,
\(x^2 + 2\alpha x + \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 0\), by which all the terms containing
this quantity disappear, and the equation is reduced

to \({V \over Q} = Ax + B\) ; and here \(V\) and \(Q\) are functions of
the particular value of \(x\), which satisfies the above-mentioned
equation. As in the last case, we shall have an
equation of the form \(r + s\sqrt{-1} = r' + s'\sqrt{-1}\), \(r\) and
\(s\) being composed of constants and the indeterminate
quantities \(A, B\) ; and these last will be found from the
equations
	\[r = r', s = s'.\]
</p>
<p>
We now differentiate the preceding equation, and, after
omitting the terms in the result that contain \(x^2 + 2\alpha x
+ \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 0\), have
	\[{d({Q \over V}) \over dx} = A + (2x + 2\alpha)(Cx + D).\]
</p>
<p>
By substituting in this expression the imaginary value
of \(x\), which satisfies the equation \(x^2 + 2\alpha x + \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = 0\),
and putting the real and imaginary terms on each side
equal, two equations will be obtained which determine \(C\) 
and \(D\).

<h2>
Integrals of Irrational Fractions
</h2>
<p>
123. When a differential involves irrational functions,
if by any means these can be transformed into others entirely
rational, their integration may be effected by the
rules already explained.
</p>
<p>
For example, let the differential be
</p>

<p>
124. We shall now consider those irrational functions
which include the radical \(\sqrt{a + b x + c x^2}\) only, and which
appear under one or other of the two forms,
	\[P dx\sqrt{a + b x + c x^2}, {P dx \over \sqrt{a + b x + c x^2}},\]
where P denotes any rational function of x. These may,
however, be included in one ; for if the first be multiplied
by the radical, and the same quantity written under it as
a denominator, it becomes
	\[{P(a + b x + c x^2)dx \over \sqrt{a + b x + c x^2}},\]
an expression of the same kind as the second.
</p>
<p>
We begin with the simple form, \({dx \over \sqrt{a + b x + c x^2}}\), which,
however, has two cases, according as the sign of \(c\) in the
denominator is positive or negative.
</p>

<p>
125. I. To integrate the differential \({dx \over \sqrt{a + b x + c x^2}}\).
	\[\text{Assume }\sqrt{a + b x + c x^2} = py + {q \over y}. \tag{1}\]
Here \(p\) and \(q\) are indeterminate constant quantities, to
which such values are to be given as shall serve to transform
the proposed differential into another that may be a
rational fraction ; we have now
	\[a + b x + c x^2 =p^2 y^2 + 2pq + {q^2 \over y^2}.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
These logarithmic functions differ from each other only
by the constant 1 (\(2\sqrt{c}\))
</p>

<p>
126. II. To integrate the differential \({dx \over \sqrt{a + b x - c x^2}}\).
	\[\text{assume }\sqrt{a + bx - c x^2} = p \sin \varphi. \tag{1}\]
\(p\) representing here an indeterminate constant, and \(\varphi\) a
variable angle. Then
	\[a + b x - c x^2 = p^2 \sin^2 \varphi = p^2 - \cos^2 \varphi ;\]
and hence, proceeding as in last article,
	\[{b^2 \over 4} - bcx + c^2x^2 =
		c p^2\cos^2\varphi + {b^2 \over 4} + ac - p^2c.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
127. We shall now integrate the formula
	\[x^n dx \over \sqrt{a + b x + c x^2},\]
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
Knowing now the integrals in the cases of \(n = 0\) and
\(n = 1\), the preceding general formula gives it in the case
of \(n = 2\) ; and in the case of \(n = 3\), it is found from the
cases of \(n = 1\) and \(n = 2\) and so on to any extent, supposing
\(n\) to be a positive number.
</p>

<p>
128. When n is negative, the formula will be better
under another form. Writing \(-n\) instead of \(+n\), and
arranging the terms of the result anew, we have
	\[\int{dx \over \sqrt{a + b x + c x^2}}
		= {1 \over (n-1)a}{\sqrt{a + b x + c x^2} \over x^{n-1}} \]
	\[
		- {2n-3 \over 2n-2} \cdot {b \over a} \int{dx \over x^{n-1}\sqrt{a + b x + c x^2}} \]
	\[
		- {n-2 \over n-1} \cdot {c \over a} \int{dx \over x^{n-2}\sqrt{a + b x + c x^2}}
	.\]
In this formula, \(n\) is understood to be positive.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
129. This formula of transformation will not apply to
the case of \(n = 1\), because then the fractions which have
\(n - 1\) in the denominator become infinite. It is therefore
necessary to investigate the integral of \(dx \over \sqrt{a + b x + c x^2}\) separately.

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
130. The folmulæ investigated from articles 125 to
128 serve for the integration of innumerable differentials.
Thus, from art. 125 we have
	\[\int{dx \over \sqrt{a + x^2}} = \ln(x + \sqrt{a + x^2}) + C\]
	\[\int{dx \over \sqrt{bx + x^2}} = \ln({1 \over 2}b + x + \sqrt{bx + x^2}) + C ;\]
and, from the first formula of art. 129

</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
This example shows that the integral is much modified
by the arbitrary constant which enters it.
</p>

<p>
131. Corresponding to these logarithmic integrals there
is a set of similar integrals which are expressed by angles
or arcs of a circle. Thus we have, art. 126
	\[\int{dx \over \sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} = \sin^{-1}{x \over a} + C,\]
	\[\int{dx \over \sqrt{ax - x^2}} =
		\cos^{-1}\left(1 - 2{x \over a}\right) + C,\]
and by formula 2 of art. 129,
	\[{a dx \over x\sqrt{x^2-a^2}} = \sec^{-1}{x \over a} + C
		= \cos^{-1}{a \over x} + C.\]
</p>

<p>
132. As an example of the way of proceeding in the
integration of a differential which involves radical quantities,
let it be proposed to integrate the differential
	\[\]
</p>
<p>...</p>


<h2>
Integration of Binomial Differentials.
</h2>
<p>
133. These differentials are represented by the formula
	\[x^{m-1}dx(a + b x^n)^{p \over q},\]
whose generality will not be affected by supposing that
m and n are whole numbers. The object we propose is
to find in what case this differential may be made rational.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
134. Since it is not possible to integrate in every case
the formula \(x^{m-1}dx(a + b x^n)^{p \over q}\), we may try to change
it into another more simple, as has been done in integrating
a differential (art. 115). We have found that
\(\int u dv = uv - \int v du\). If therefore we can decompose the
differential into two factors, one of which being integrable,
may be represented by \(dv\), and the other by \(u\),
the integration of the proposed differential will be made
to depend on that of \(v du\), which in some cases will be
more simple than the proposed differential. This method,
which is at once extensive and elegant, is called <i>integration
by parts</i>.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
135. There is another way of reduction by which the
exponent of the quantity within the parenthesis may be
diminished by an unit ; for this purpose it is only necessary
to observe that
	\[\int x^{m-1}dx(a + b x^n)^p =
	.\]

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
136. It is evident that if m and n were negative, the
folmulæ (A) and (B) would not accomplish the purpose
for which they have been investigated ; they would then
increase the exponent of x without the parenthesis, as
well as that of the parenthesis itself ; but by reversing
them we shall find others suited to the case in question.
From formula (A) we deduce
	\[\int x^{m-n-1}dx(a + b x^n)^p =
	.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
137. Let the formula be \(\int{x^{m-1}dx \over \sqrt{1-x^2}}\), where \(m\) is a whole
positive number. Making \(a = 1, b = -1, n = 2,
p = -{1 \over 2}\), we find
	\[\int{x^{m-1}dx \over \sqrt{1-x^2}} = -{x^{m-2}\sqrt{1-x^2} \over m - 1}
		+ {m - 2 \over m - 1}\int{x^{m-3}dx \over \sqrt{1-x^2}}.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
138. Let us now consider the formulæ which answer
to the case of \(m\) negative ; then by formula (C) art. 136,
	\[\int{x^{-m-1} dx \over \sqrt{1 - x^2}} = -{x^{-m}\sqrt{1 - x^2} \over m}
		+ {m-1 \over m}\int{x^{-m+1} dx \over \sqrt{1 - x^2}}.\]
Writing \(-m\) instead of \(-m-1\), this becomes
	\[\int{dx \over x^m\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = {-\sqrt{1 - x^2} \over (m-1)x^{m-1}}
		+ {m-2 \over m-1}\int{dx \over x^{m-2}\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
From these two series of equations we deduce, as in the
former article, a series of differentials integrated by logarithms,
and another by algebraic folmulæ.
</p>


<h2>
Integration by Series
</h2>
<p>
139. The integral \(\int X dx\) is easily found when the
function \(X\) is expanded into a series, because then we have
only to integrate a series of single terms in succession, to
which the rule of art. 104 immediately applies.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
140. The object of integration by series being to obtain
approximate values of the integrals when they cannot
be found accurately, it is important to have several
series, so that we may be able to choose one convergent
for a proposed value of \(x\). Ascending series, or those
which proceed by positive and increasing powers of \(x\), do
not converge sufficiently unless \(x\) be a small fraction, as
happens with the series of Ex. 2 ; whilst those which
proceed by the negative powers of \(x\), or descending series,
converge only so as to be of use when a ; is a large number.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
141. In having recourse to series, it is sufficient to find
one, of which the terms are separately integrable, although
each may not have the form
</p>
<p>...</p>


<h2>
Integration of Logarithmic Functions
</h2>
<p>
142. Let it be required to integrate \(P dx(\ln x)^n\), that is,
the nth power of Napier’s logarithm of \(x\) multiplied by
\(P dx\), \(P\) being an algebraic function of \(x\). Here we apply
the formula \(\int u dv = uv - \int v du\) ; and making \(u = (\ln x)^n\),
from which we find \(du = n(\ln x)^{n-1}{dx \over x}\), also \(dv = P dx\),
we have, making in order to abridge \(\int P dx = N\),
If now we represent the integral \(\int {dx \over x}N\) by \(M\), we shall
have
	\[\int {dx \over x}N(\ln x)^{n-1} =
		M(\ln x)^{n-1} - (n-1)\int {dx \over x}N(\ln x)^{n-2}M.\]
By this reduction the proposed integral is made to depend
on another of the same kind, in which the exponent
of the logarithm is an unit less. Thus, if \(P = x^m\), we have
	\[\int x^m dx(\ln x)^n =
		{x^{m+1} \over m+1}(\ln x)^n - {n \over m+1}\int (\ln x)^{n-1}x^m dx.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
It is evident that this will always terminate when n is
a whole number.
</p>

<p>
143. If \(n\) be a whole negative number, we must apply
the formula \(\int u dv = uv - \int v du\) so as to increase the exponent
of the logarithm. Thus in the differential
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
The integral of this last quantity is a transcendental of
a peculiar kind, which cannot be otherwise expressed than
by infinite series.
</p>


<h2>
Integration of Exponential Functions.
</h2>
<p>
144. It appears from art. 19, that \(d(a^x) - \ln(a)a^x dx\),
therefore
	\[\int a^x dx = {a^x \over \ln a} + C.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
145. In other cases we may have recourse to the method
of integration by parts (art. 134). Thus, let the differential
be \(x^n a^x dx\), then, by the formula \(\int u dv = uv - \int v du\),
making \(u = x^n, dv = a^x dx\), we find
	\[\int a^x x^n dx = {a^x x^n \over \ln a} - {n \over \ln a}\int a^x x^{n-1} dx.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
146. If the exponent n be negative, by following the
same method we may increase the exponent of x. Accordingly,
from the formula \(\int u dv = uv - \int v du\) making
	\[\int{a^x dx \over x^n} = {-a^x \over (n-1)x^{n-1}} +
		{\ln a \over n - 1}\int{a^x dx \over x^{n-1}}.\]
By repeating this transformation, we bring the integral
\(\int {a^x dx \over x^n}\) to depend at last on \(\int a^x dx \over x\).
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
These two integrals involve the same difficulty, and have
greatly exercised the ingenuity of analysts. It appears
they can only be integrated by infinite series. See on this
subject, Lacroix, <i>Traité du Calcul Différentiel??</i>, vol. iii. No.
1224.
</p>

<p>
147. If \(n\) be a fraction, either of the preceding methods
will apply to reduce the exponent of \(x\) to some fraction
between 0 and +1 or -1 ; and then recourse must be
had to the method of infinite series.
Whatever has been done in regard to the integral of
\(x^n a^x dx\), will apply \(P a^x dx\), supposing \(P\) to be any function
of \(x\) whatever.
</p>
<p>...</p>


<h2>
Integration of Angular or Circular Functions
</h2>
<p>
148. There are several ways of integrating expressions
which contain circular or trigonometrical functions of a
variable.
</p>
<p>
Method I. Let \(x\) be an arc whose sine or cosine is \(z\) ;
for example, let \(\sin x = z\), then
	\[\cos x = \sqrt{1-z^2}, dx = {dz \over \sqrt{1-z^2}},\]
	\[dx \sin^m x \cos^n x = z^m(1-z^2)^{n-1 \over 2}dx.\]
</p>

<p>
149. Method II. The powers of the sine or cosine
may be transformed into series, of which the terms are
sines or cosines of the multiples of the arc ; the terms to
be integrated will then have the form \(dx \cos kx, dx \sin
kx\). Now
	\[\int dx \cos kx = {1 \over k}\sin kx + C ;\]
	\[\int dx \sin kx = -{1 \over k}\cos kx + C ;\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
150. Method III.—It has been found (Algebra, art.
270), that e being the base of Napier’s logarithms,
	\[\cos x = {e^{x\sqrt{-1}} + e^{-x\sqrt{-1}} \over 2} ;\]
	\[\sin x = {e^{x\sqrt{-1}} - e^{x\sqrt{-1}} \over 2\sqrt{-1}}.\]
</p>
<p>
These exponential expressions for the sine and cosine
enable us to transform differentials containing circular
functions into others involving exponential and logarithmic
functions, and to integrate by the methods explained (art.
140-145).
</p>

<p>
151. Method IV.—We may reduce the integration of
such a differential as \(\sin^m x \cos^n x dx\), to that of another
in which the indices of the sine or cosine are smaller numbers,
by the formula \(\int u dv = uv - \int v du\). For, making \(u
= \sin^{m-1} x\) ; and \(dv = dx \sin x \cos^n x\), we find \(v =
-{\cos^{n+1}x \over n + 1}\), and
	\[dx \sin^m x \cos^n x = ... .\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
152. When \(m\) and \(n\) are negative, these formulas require
some modification. The first, by changing \(n\) into
\(-n\), gives
	\[\int{dx\sin^m x \over \cos^n x} = ... . \tag{γ}\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
153. If we make \(m\) or \(n = 0\), we have
	\[\int{dx \sin^m x} = {-\cos x\sin^{m-1}x \over m}
		+ {m - 1 \over m}\int{dx \sin^{m-2}x},\]
	\[\int{dx \cos^n x} = { \sin x\cos^{n-1}x \over n}
		+ {n - 1 \over n}\int{dx \cos^{n-2}x},\]
	\[\int{dx \sin^m x} = {-\cos x \over (m - 1)\sin^{m-1}x}
		+ {m - 2 \over m - 1}\int{dx \over \sin^{m-2}x},\]
	\[\int{dx \cos^n x} = { \sin x \over (n - 1)\cos^{n-1}x}
		+ {n - 2 \over n - 1}\int{dx \over \cos^{n-2}x}.\]
</p>

<p>
154. When the exponents of the sine and cosine are
both negative, we multiply the numerator by \(\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x
= 1\), and have
	\[\int{dx \over \sin^m x \cos^n x} =
		\int{dx \over \sin^{m-2} x \cos^n x} +
		\int{dx \over \sin^m x \cos^{n-2} x},\]
fractions with \(\sin x\) or \(\cos x\) in the denominator.
</p>
<p>
If \(m = n\), then because \(\sin x \cos x = {1 \over 2}\sin 2x\), by
making \(2x = z\), the fraction takes the form of the third
of the preceding folmulæ.
</p>

<p>
155. We shall conclude this branch of the subject by
integrating four of the more elementary circular functions.

Applications of the Integral Calculus
</h2>
<p>
Before we proceed farther in the explanation of the
theory of the calculus, we shall apply its principles to
some of the more important problems in Geometry.

Volume 7
<h3>
Quadrature of Curves
</h3>
<p>
156. Let \(AQ = x, PQ = y\), be the co-ordinates of a
curve, of which \(AB\) is the axis ; and let the area \(CDQP\),
comprehended between \(CD\), an ordinate given in position,
and \(PQ\) any other ordinate, be denoted by \(s\). We
have found (art. 69) that \(ds = y dx\) ; therefore, in any
curve whatever, area \(s = \int y dx\).
</p>
<p>
Ex. 1.
	Let the curve be a parabola, of which \(p\) is the
	parameter. By the nature of the curve, \(y^2 = px\), and
	\(y = p^{1 \over 2} x^{1 \over 2}\), and \(y dx = p^{1 \over 2} x^{1 \over 2}dx\) ; therefore, taking the
	integral by art. 104,
	\[s = \int y dx = {2 \over 3}p^{1 \over 2} x^{1 \over 2} + c = {2 \over 3} yx + C \tag{1}\]
</p>
<p>
Ex. 2.
	Let the curve be a circle Kpa (see fig. 7, art.
	66), of which Aa is a diameter. Suppose the origin of coordinates
	to be at \(O\), the centre ; let Ob be the radius perpendicular
	to \(OA\) ; put \(OQ = x, pQ = y\), \(OA\) the radius
	\(= a\), the space \(OQpb = s\) ; by the nature of the circle
	\(x^2 + y^2 = a^2\), and \(y = \sqrt{a^2 - x^2}\) ; hence
	\[s = \int y dx = \int dx \sqrt{a^2 - x^2}.\]
</p>
<p>
	This integral cannot be expressed in finite algebraic
	terms ; therefore recourse must be had to an infinite series.
	...
	This series converges slowly, so that a considerable number
	of terms would be required to give its value near the
	truth. If we make \(x = \cos \text{arc }60°\), then, drawing the
	radius \(Op\), the area \(OQpb\) will manifestly be made up of
	the sector \(POb\), which is \(1 \over 12\) of the area of the circle, and
	the triangle \(OQp\), which is
	\[{1 \over 2} OQ \cdot pQ = {\sqrt{3} \over 8} a^2.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
157. Since the area of any plane curve is expressed by
an integral \(\int y dx\), in which \(y\) the ordinate is some function
of \(x\) the absciss, so, on the other hand, any integral
may be represented geometrically by the area of a curve.
The geometrical representation of an integral shows distinctly
wherein it differs from a common analytic function,
such as \(a + b x^n\), or \(ax\), or \(\sin x, \text{&c.}\) These last have
determinate values corresponding to any given value of
\(x\), and each is independent of its preceding and following
values ; but the magnitude of the space represented
by an integral \(\int y dx\) is the increment that a certain area
receives while the variable \(x\) passes from one state of magnitude
to another. Thus the absolute magnitude of the
space \(CDQP\) (fig. 11), which represents an integral \(\int y dx\),
and which, when the curve is a parabola, is expressed by
\({2 \over 3}xy + C\), cannot be known before \(C\) is determined, or else
eliminated from the expression.
</p>
<p>
Whatever be the nature of the curve, the integral
\(\int y dx = \text{space }CPQD\) is correctly indicated, so as to admit
of being computed, when we say that it is generated
while the variable \(x\) increases from any value \(= AD\), to

another value \(= AQ\), the lines \(AD, AQ\) being supposed
given in magnitude, and the relation between \(x\) and \(y\)
known. The same thing is briefly indicated by this notation :
	\[\text{area }CPQD = \int_a^x y dx,\]
in which \(a\) and \(x\) denote the lines \(AD\) and \(AQ\).
</p>
<p>
From what has been shown it appears that an integral
is an indeterminate quantity, the result of a change in the
value of its variable ; and that to know its absolute value
we must know the values of the variable at its commencement
and completion.
</p>

<p>
158. The analogy between a curvilineal area and an integral
indicates a general method of finding its numerical
value to any degree of nearness. Supposing \(y\) to be any
function of \(x\), let it be proposed to find the integral \(\int y dx\)
between \(x = a\) and \(x = b\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
159. Supposing the ordinates \(PQ, P'Q', \text{&c.}\) to go on
continually increasing, the inscribed rectangles will be
constructed on the 1st, 2d, 3d, &c. ordinates, and the circumscribing
rectangles on the 2d, 4th, 6th, &c.
</p>
<p>
Observing now that the ordinates are the values of \(y\) 
corresponding to \(AQ, AQ', \text{&c.}\) values of \(x\), which differ
by the common interval \(QQ'\), we have manifestly the following
rule for approximating to an integral \(\int y dx\) between
the limits of \(x = AQ = a\) and \(x = A Q^m = b\). Divide
the interval \(QQ''' = b - a\) into \(n\) equal parts, each
equal to \(h\).
</p>
<p>
Find \(Y, Y', Y'', .... Y^{(n)}\) the particular values of \(Y\) 
corresponding to \(x = a, x = a + h, x = a + 2h ...
x = a + nh = b\).
</p>
<p>
Then, supposing the ordinates to go on increasing,

</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
Leibnitz and his followers considered the integral \(\int y dx\)
as the sum of the infinitely little elements \(YA, Y'A, \text{&c.}\)
Hence the origin of the terms integral, to integrate, integration,
&c. When \(A\) is infinitely little, and represented
by \(dx\), the differential of \(x\), then \(y dx\) is the differential
of the integral.

<h3>
Rectification of Curves
</h3>
<p>
160. We have found (art. 72) that \(z\) being any arc of
a curve referred to an axis by rectangular co-ordinates

\(x, y\), the differential of the arc, viz. \(dz, = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}\). We
are now to apply the calculus to particular curves.
</p>
<p>
Ex. 1. Let the curve be a parabola (fig. 16) of which
the parameter \(= 2a\), the absciss \(AQ = x\), the ordinate
\(PQ = y\). The equation of the curve, \(2ax = y^2\), gives

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
161. We shall here explain the remarkable property of
the ellipse, first discovered by Fagnani, as has been mentioned,
page 640, and which has proved the fertile germ
of some of the finest discoveries in the modern analysis.
In the ellipse ABa, let \(DE\) be a tangent at any point
\(D\) in the curve, draw \(CE\) from the centre perpendicular to

the tangent, and parallel to it draw the semidiameter CH
which will be the conjugate to that drawn from \(C\) through
\(D\) ; and draw \(HK\) perpendicular to the axis. Let \(CA
= 1, CB = b, \sqrt{1-b^2}\), the eccentricity, \(= e\). Make the
perpendicular \(CE = p\), the tangent \(DE = t\), the angle
\(ACE = CHK = \varphi\), and the arc \(AD = z’\). By the nature
of the ellipse,

</p>


<h3>
Cubature of Solids
</h3>
<p>
162. Let \(AB\) be the axis of any plane curve \(APP'\), and
\(PQ, P'Q'\) ordinates perpendicular to the axis ; draw \(PH\)
perpendicular to the ordinate \(P'Q'\), and \(P'K\) perpendicular
to \(PQ\). Conceive now the plane figure \(AP'Q'\) to revolve
about the axis \(AB\) ; the curve \(AP\) will generate a solid
AP'E'p', called a <i>solid of revolution</i> ; and the rectangles

\(PQQ'H, P'Q'QK\) will generate cylinders whose bases are
circles \(PEp, P'E'p'\), and common altitude \(QQ'\).
Fig. 27.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
163. Ex. 1. Let the solid be a paraboloid generated by
the revolution of a parabola \(AP\) about its axis \(AQ\). By
the nature of the curve, \(y^2 = ax\) ; therefore, in this case,
	\[s = \pi\int ax dx = {1 \over 2}\pi a x^2 + C = {1 \over 2}\pi x y^2 + C.\]
</p>
<p>
If the integral begin when \(x = 0\), then also \(s = 0\) and
\(C = 0\) ; now \(\pi x y^2\) is the content of a cylinder having the
same base as the paraboloid, therefore, <i>a paraboloid is half
a cylinder of the same base and altitude</i>.
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
If the integral begin when \(x = 0\), then \(C = 0\). If we
make \(x = q\) we got \({8 \over 15}p^2\cdot q\pi\) for half the content of the
solid generated by the curve \(ADB\).
</p>


<h3>
Surfaces of Solids.
</h3>
<p>
164. Let \(AB\) be the axis of any plane curve \(APP'\), and
\(PQ, FQ'\) ordinates to the axis ; draw \(PE, P'E\) tangents to
the curve at \(P\) and \(P'\), meeting in \(E\) ; draw \(EF\) perpendicular

to \(AB\), and draw the chord \(PP'\). Suppose now the
curve to revolve about its axis \(AB\) ; the arc \(APP'\) will generate
a curve surface, to be found ; the portion \(PP'\) of
the arc will generate an increment of that surface, which,
by an axiom in geometry, will be less than the sum of the
conical surfaces generated by the tangents \(PE, P'E\), but
greater than the conical surface generated by the chord
\(PF\). Put \(AQ = x, AQ' = x', PQ = y, P'Q' = y', EF = y''\),
arc \(AP = z\), arc \(AP' = z'\), surface generated by arc \(AP
= v\), surface generated by arc \(AP' = v'\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
165. Ex. 1. Let the solid be a sphere, of which the radius
is a. Then, making \(AQ = x, PQ = y\), the \(\text{arc }AP = z\),
the surface of the segment cut off by the plane \(Pp = v\) ;
the equation of the curve being \(y = \sqrt{2ax - x^2}\), we have
	\[dy = {a dx-x dx \over \sqrt{2ax-x^2}},\]
	\[dz = \sqrt{dx^2+dy^2} = {a dx \over \sqrt{2ax-x^2}} = {a dx \over y},\]
	\[dv = 2 \pi y dz = 2a \pi dx,\]
and the surface	\(v = 2a \pi x\) ;
here no constant is wanted, because we suppose that
when \(x = 0\), then \(v = 0\).
</p>
<p>
Since \(2a\pi\) is the circumference of a circle whose diameter
is \(a\), it follows that <i>the curve surface of a segment of
a sphere is equal to a rectangle contained by a straight line
equal to the circumference of the sphere and the height of the
segment ; and hence it follows, that the whole surface of
the sphere is four times the area of one of its great circles</i>.
These conclusions were found by Archimedes.
Ex. 2. To find the surface of a paraboloid. Put \(AQ = x,
PQ = y, \text{arc }AP = z\), curve surface generated by \(AP =
v\), the parameter \(= 2a\). We found (article 160)

</p>


<h3>
Rectification of Curves of Double Curvature
</h3>
<p>
166. Let \(CPD\) be a line of double curvature referred to
three co-ordinate planes \(YAX, ZAX, ZAY\). From every
point in the curve let perpendiculars \(PF, \text{&c.}\) be drawn to
one of the planes, \(YAX\) ; these will all be in the surface of
a cylinder that meets the plane in a curve \(C'P'D\), which will
be the projection of the proposed curve. Again, from P'
draw \(P'Q, P'R\) perpendicular to \(AX, AY\). Let \(AQ = P'R
= x, AR = FQ = y, FP = z\), the \(\text{arc }CP = v\), its projection
\(C'P' = v'\) : Then \(dv' = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}\), (art 72). Suppose
now the cylindric surface to be extended into a plane
surface ; the curve \(CPD\) will then be changed into a common
plane curve, and its projection \(C'P'D'\) into a straight
line of the same length as before. We may now consider

\(v'\) and \(z\) as co-ordinates of the curve \(v\), and then \(dv
= \sqrt{dv'^2 + dz^2}\) ; therefore, by substituting for \(dv'^2\) its value
\(dx^2 + dy^2\), we find
	\[dv = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2}.\]
This is a general formula for the rectification of any line
of double curvature. The nature of the line will be expressed
by two equations \(f(x, y) = 0, F(x, z) = 0\). From
these we find \(dy = P dx, dz = Q dx\), expressions in which
\(P\) and \(Q\) are functions of \(x\) only. Thus we have
\(dv = \sqrt{1 + P^2 + Q^2} = dx R\), \(R\) being a function of the
single variable \(x\). The integral \(v = \int R dx\) may now be
found by the ordinary rules.

<h2>
Integration of Differential Equations of two Variables
</h2>
<p>
167. Every differential equation of the first order which
contains only the single powers of dx and dy, has the form
\(M dx + N dy = 0\), and it expresses the relation which
subsists between the variable \(x\), the function \(y\), and its
differential co-efficient \(dy \over dx\). The object of inquiry is to
discover, if possible, the primitive equation \(f(x, y) = 0\),
which by differentiation may produce the proposed differential equation.
</p>

<p>
168. The method which first presented itself to analysts
was to endeavour to separate the variables, so as to give
it the form \(X dx + Y dy = 0\), \(X\) being a function of \(x\) 
alone, and \(Y\) a function of \(y\). When this can be done,
the differentials \(X dx, Y dy\) are separately integrable, and
we have \(\int X dx + \int Y dy = C\) an arbitrary constant.

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
169. The variables may always be separated in <i>homogeneous
equations</i>, the distinguishing property of which is,
that the sum of the exponents of \(x\) and \(y\) is the same in
each of its terms. For example,
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
171. The separation of the variables is easily effected
in the equation \(dy + Py dx = Q dx\), where \(P\) and \(Q\) denote
any functions whatever of \(x\). Substituting \(Xz\) and
\(z dX + X dz\) instead of y and dy, it becomes
	\[z dX + X dz + PXz dx = Q dx.\]

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
172. The early writers on the integral calculus classed
differential equations by the number of their terms. In
equations which had but two terms, and whose form is
consequently \(\beta u^g z^h dz = a u^e z^f du\), the variables are separated
immediately, since we thence deduce \(\beta z^{h-f} dz
= a u^{e-g} du\). This however is not the case with equations
of three terms, which are expressed by the formula
	\[\gamma u^i z^k dz + \beta u^g z^h du = a u^e z^f du.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
173. When a differential equation is the immediate result
of the differentiation of a known function, then that
function, put equal to \(C\) a constant, will be the integral
required. The differential equation \(x dy + y dx = 0\) is of
this class ; it is the differential of the product \(xy\), therefore
the primitive equation is \(xy = C\). A differential equation
may, however, not be the immediate result of the
differentiation of a function of \(x\) and \(y\) ; it may be formed
by the elimination of some constant quantity contained
in the function and also in its differential (art. 54) ; or it
may be the result after the differential of the primitive
has been divided by some factor common to all its terms.
Thus, if the primitive be \(y = cx\), or \(y - cx = 0\), the differential
equation is \(dy - c dx = 0\). If however we eliminate
\(c\) by the usual algebraic process, we find \(x dy - y dx = 0\),
an expression which is not the immediate result of any
differentiation. The same result will be obtained if the
primitive \(x = cy\) be put under the form \({x \over y} = c\) ; for then,
by differentiating, \({y dx - x dy \over y^2} = 0\), and, rejecting the factor
\({1 \over y^2}, y dx - x dy = 0\). This expression is not an exact
differential ; however, it becomes so by restoring the factor
\(1 \over y^2\), and then it is the differential of \(x \over y\).
</p>

<p>
174. In general let \(u = f(x, y)\) be the primitive equation,
the differential being \(du = M dx + N dy\), where \(M\)
denotes \(du \over dx\), that is, the differential co-efficient found on
the supposition that \(x\) is variable and \(y\) constant, and \(N\)
denotes \(du \over dy\) the co-efficient taken on the reverse hypothesis
of \(y\) being variable and \(x\) constant ; now we have
found that \({d^2u \over dx dy} = {d^2u \over dy dx}\) (art. 89) ; therefore, if \(M dx + N dy\)
be the differential of \(u = f(x, y)\), then
	\[{dM \over dy} = {dN \over dx} \tag{1}\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
175. If in the equation \(M dx + N dy = 0\), the condition
of integrability, viz. \({dM \over dy} = {dN \over dx}\), is not satisfied, we may
next inquire whether some factor, a function of \(x\) and \(y\),
can be found by which the expression \(M dx + N dy\) can
be rendered a complete differential.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
176. Let \(M\) be any function of \(x\) and \(y\), and let \(u = \int M dx\),
the integral being taken on the supposition that \(x\) is variable
and \(y\) constant : it is sometimes required that the
differential co-efficient \(du \over dy\) be found ; or, in other words,
that the differential of \(\int M dx\) relatively to \(y\) be found
without having actually integrated the expression relatively
to \(x\).

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
177. The elimination of a constant contained in a primitive
equation may introduce the second or higher powers
of the differentials into the resulting differential equation
(art. 53) : in such cases we must find the values of \(dy \over dx\)
by the resolution of an equation.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
178. When the equation contains only one of the variables,
\(x\) for example, we deduce from it \(dy \over dx = X\), and

\(y = \int X dx\) ; but if the equation be more easily resolvable
with respect to \(x\) than with respect to the co-efficient
which we will represent by p, and if we have also
dx
\(x = P\), a function of \(p\), and thence \(dx = dP\) ; then, since
\(dy = p dx\), therefore \(dy = p dP\) and \(y = pP - \int P dp\). The
relation between \(x\) and \(y\) is now to be found by eliminating
\(p\) by means of the equations
	\[x = P, y = Pp - \int P dp.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
179. When the primitive equation cannot be deduced
from the differential equation by any of the known artifices
of analysis, then, as a last resource, recourse must be had
to approximation by infinite series.
</p>
<p>...</p>


<h2>
Differential Equations of the Second and Higher Orders
</h2>
<p>
180. The difficulty of the integrations becomes so much
the greater the higher the order of the differential co-efficients
which they involve, and we only succeed in effecting
it in a very small number of very limited equations.
</p>
<p>
Let the expression
	\[f(x, y, c, c') = 0 \tag{1}\]
represent any primitive equation composed of the variables
\(x, y\), and two constant quantities \(c, d\), besides any other
constants. By differentiation (as explained art. 48-54),
there is formed its differential equation of the first order,
which will contain \(dy \over dx\). Let this differential co-efficient be
represented by \(p\), and let \(q = {dp \over dx} = {d^2y \over dx^2}\). The differential
of the first order will contain \(x, y, p, c, c'\), and may be
represented by
	\[f'(x, y, p, c, c') = 0 \tag{2}\]
By differentiating this equation we obtain another which
contains also \({d^2y \over dx^2} = q\), and may be expressed by
	\[f''(x, y, p, q, c, c') = 0 \tag{3}\]
</p>
<p>
Since these three equations must hold true at once, we
may eliminate the constants \(c, d\), and the result will be
a single equation,
	\[F(x, y, p, q) = 0 \tag{4}\]
in which \(c, d\) are not found. This will be the differential
equation of the second order, deducible from the primitive
(1), and which is independent of the constants \(c, d\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
181. Since two of the constants in a primitive equation
may not be found in the differential equation of the second
order derived from it, so, reversely, in returning from a differential
equation of the second order to its absolute primitive,
the latter cannot be complete unless it contain two arbitrary
constants, which are not in the former ; and as the
same differential equation of the second order may be
obtained from two distinct differential equations of the first
order, it follows that every differential equation of the second
order has two distinct differential equations of the first
order, each having its own arbitrary constant ; and these
again have one and the same absolute primitive equation.
The properties of differential equations of the third and
higher orders are perfectly analogous to these.
</p>

<p>
182. The most simple differential equation of the second
order is \({d^2y \over dx^2} = X\), a function of \(x\) ; then \({dy \over dx} = \int X dx\).

</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
183. When a differential equation of the second order
involves \(dy \over dx\) and \(d^2y \over dx^2\) and constants ; if we put \({dy \over dx} = p\),
then, regarding \(dx\) as constant \({d^2y \over dx^2} = {dp \over dx}\) ; the equation
will now involve \(p, dp, dx\) and constants ; and it will be
of the first order, in respect of \(p\) and \(x\). We may thence
find \(dx = P dp\), \(P\) being here put for some function of \(p\) ;
and since \(dy = p dx = Pp dp\), we have
	\[x = \int P dp, y = \int Pp dp.\]
</p>
<p>
These integrals being found, and a constant added to
each, by eliminating \(p\), we find an equation expressing
the relation between \(x\) and \(y\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
184. We may remark, that the equation \(x = C + \int{dp \over P}\), and
\(dy = C' + \int{p dp \over P}\), severally satisfy the differential equation
\({dp \over dx} = P\) ; and that, by supposing their second members
integrated, they will be only of the first order. This
agrees with what was observed, art. 181, viz. that there
are two equations of the first order which satisfy a differential
equation of the second order.
</p>

<p>
185. Let us now consider differentials of the form \({d^2y \over dx^2} = Y\)
\(Y\) representing any function of \(y\). If we make \(dy = p dx\),
we thence deduce \(dx = {dy \over p}\), which gives
\({d^2y \over dx^2} = {dp \over dx} = {p dp \over dy}\).
Substituting this in the proposed equation, there results
from it \(p dp = Y dy\) ; by integrating, we find \(p^2 = 2\int Y dy
+?? C\), and hence
	\[p = {dy \over dx} = \sqrt{C + 2\int Y d}, \text{and }
		x = \int{dy \over \sqrt{C + 2\int Y d}} + C'.\]
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
186. We have seen in the differential calculus, art. 93, that
beyond the first order the form of the differential equations
would be changed, according as \(x\) or \(y\), or even a
function of these quantities, was assumed as the independent
variable ; which comes to the same thing as assuming
that \(dx\), or \(dy\), or a given function of these variables, was
constant. It is therefore necessary, in integrating equations
which exceed the first degree, to know upon which
of these hypotheses it has been calculated. The preceding
examples all correspond to the case of \(y\) being a function
of \(x\), and consequently of dx being constant ; but it
will be easy to discover, among relations deduced relatively
to other hypotheses, to which of them they may be referred.
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
187. When the equation contains \({d^2y \over dx^2}, {dy \over dx}\) and the variable
\(x\), it may, as before, be transformed into a differential
equation of the first order, by substituting \(p dx\) for \(dy\),
and \(dp dx\) for \(d^2y\) ; then, if the primitive of that differential
equation, and thence the value of \(p\) in terms of \(x\), can
be found, we may have the value of \(y\) from the formula
\(y = \int p dx\) ; or else if we have the value of \(x\) in terms of
\(p\), then, because \(\int p dx = px - \int x dp\), we shall have \(y = px
- \int x dp\).
</p>
<p>...</p>

<p>
188. If the proposed differential equation is composed
of \({d^2y \over dx^2}, {dy \over dx}\), and \(y\), we may, as before, put \(p = {dy \over dx}\) from
which we get \({d^2y \over dx^2} = {dp \over dx} = {p dp \over dy}\) ; the equation will now
involve \(dp, dy, p\) and \(y\) only. When the primitive equation
can be found, and thence the value of p in terms of
\(y\), we may find \(x\) by the formula \(x = \int{dy \over p}\) ; but when \(y\)
is expressed by \(p\), we may then employ the formula
	\[x = {y \over p} + \int{y dp\over p^2}.\]
</p>

<p>
189. Differentials of the second order, which have this
from,
	\[{d^2y \over dx^2} + P{dy \over dx} + Qy = R,\]

in which \(P, Q, R\) are any functions of \(x\), are called <i>linear</i>,
also equations of <i>first degree</i>, because \(y\) is only of one
dimension. It will easily be understood that the difficulty
of finding the primitive equation will be greater than
in the like equation of the first order ; and, indeed, except
in particular cases, there is no known method of reducing
the integration to the finding of the differential of a single
variable ; that is, to the quadrature of a curve. If
\(R = 0\), in which case the equation is
	\[{d^2y \over dx^2} + P{dy \over dx} + Qy = 0,\]

</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
This last expression, which satisfies the proposed equation
for all values of \(k\), agrees with it likewise if \(k = 0\), or
\(b = a\) ; and, in that case, it becomes
	\[y = e^x(c + c'x).\]
</p>

<p>190. When \(P\) and \(Q\) are variable quantities, functions
of \(x\), then if \(v\) and \(v'\) are two values of \(y\) which each satisfy
the equation
	\[{d^2y \over dx^2} + P{dy \over dx} + Q??y = 0,\]
we may take
	\[y = cv + c'v'??\]
for the complete primitive equation. For then \(dy = c dv
+ c'?? dv', d^2y = c d^2v + c'?? d^2v'??\), and the differential equation
becomes
	\[c\left({d^2v \over dx^2} + P{dv \over dx} + Qv\right) +
		c'??\left({d^2v'?? \over dx^2} + P{dv' \over dx} + Qv'\right) = 0.\]
Now, by hypothesis,
	\[{d^2v \over dx^2} + P{dv \over dx} + Qv = 0 ;
		{d^2v' \over dx^2} + P{dv' \over dx} + Q??v' = 0.\]
Therefore the equation is identical, and so the value of \(y\)
is truly determined.
</p>
<p>
As an example of the integration of a differential equation
of the second degree, see the article Arch (art. 57).
</p>

<p>
191. We shall now give an example of the integration
of a differential equation of the first degree and the second
order.
<p>
</p>
Let the equation be
	\[d^2y + a x^n y dx^2 = 0.\]
If we suppose
	\[y = A x^{\alpha} + B x^{\alpha+\delta} + C x^{\alpha+2\delta} + \text{&c.}\]
and that the series of exponents is an increasing one,
or that \(\delta\) is positive, we may, when \(x\) is supposed very
small, conceive \(y\) to reduce itself to its first term, since
the others are too small to be compared with this first.
On this supposition, we may confine ourselves to assuming
	\[y = A x^\alpha ; \text{then }d^2y = \alpha(\alpha-1)A x^{\alpha-2}dx^2,\]
and the proposed equation will become
	\[\alpha(\alpha-1)A x^{\alpha-2} + a A x^{\alpha+n} = 0.\]
</p>
<p>
It is not possible to determine a so as to make the two
exponents \(\alpha - 2\) and \(\alpha + n\) equal, except in the particular
case of \(n = -2\) ; but the exponent of x being
greater in the second term than the first, we may neglect
one of these terms in comparison with the other ; and the
equation may then be verified in two ways (by approximation),

viz. by mailing \(\alpha = 0\), and \(\alpha = 1\), since upon
either hypothesis the term \(\alpha(\alpha — 1)A x^{\alpha-2}\) (the greatest
in the equation) vanishes : \(A\), therefore, remains indeterminate,
and we have two series, one beginning with \(A\),
and the other with \(Ax\).
</p>
<p>
If we take successively
	\[y = A + B x^{\delta} + c x^{2\delta} + \text{&c.}\]
	\[y = A x^{1+\delta} + B x^{1+\delta} + c x^{1+2??\delta} + \text{&c.}\]
and substitute for y these values, and for (Py its corresponding
values, we shall then find, by properly arranging
the terms, that 3 must be = 2 ; and, in either case, determining
the values of the co-efficients A, B, C, &c. we arrive
at these two series,)
	\[A - {aA x^{n+2} \over (n+1)(n+2)} + {a^2A x^{2n+4} \over (n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)(2n+4)}\]
		\[-{a^3A x^{3n+6} \over (n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)(2n+4)(3n+5)(3n+6)} + \text{&c.}\]
	\[A x - {aA x^{n+3} \over (n+2)(n+3)} + {a^2A x^{2n+5} \over (n+2)(n+3)(2n+4)(2n+5)}\]
		\[-{a^3A x^{3n+7} \over (n+2)(n+3)(2n+4)(2n+5)(3n+6)(3n+7)} + \text{&c.}\]
</p>
<p>
These developments are only particular cases, since
they contain each but one arbitrary constant \(A\) ; but, on
account of the particular form of the proposed example
(189), we shall obtain a general expression for \(y\), by
writing in the latter of them \(A_1\) for \(A\), and taking their
sum.
</p>


<h2>
A Few More Examples
</h2>
<p>
Having now given as full a view of the principles of the
fluxional calculus as we conceive to be compatible with
the nature of our work, we shall conclude with a few
more examples of its application to geometry.
</p>

<h3>
Problem 1.
</h3>
<p>
To find the length of the enlarged meridian in Mercator's,
or rather Wright's projection of the sphere.
</p>
<p>
In this projection, the meridians and parallels of latitude
are straight lines, which intersect each other at right
angles ; and the projection of any small arc of a meridian
(as one minute), reckoned from any parallel, is to the projection
of a like arc of longitude in that parallel, as radius
to the cosine of the latitude of the parallel, that is, in the
same ratio as the arcs themselves in the sphere. Supposing
the radius of the sphere to be unity, let \(v\) be any arc of
latitude reckoned from the equator, \(z\) its projection on the
chart, or the enlarged meridian.

</p>

<h3>
Problem 2.
</h3>
<p>
If any number of straight lines are drawn according
to some determinate law, it is required to find the nature
of a curve to which these are tangents.
</p>
<p>
For example, let \(AE\) be a straight line given by position,
and \(K\) a given point without it ; let any number of
lines \(KD, KD', \text{&c.}\) be drawn to meet \(AE\) in \(D, D', \text{&c.}\) ;
and let perpendiculars \(DC, D'C', \text{&c.}\) be drawn to these
lines ; it is required to find the nature of the curve \(ACC'\),
to which these perpendiculars are tangents.
</p>
<p>
Without attending to the particular case, we shall resolve
the general problem, and suppose \(AE\) to be the axis of
the curve, A being the origin of the co-ordinates, and \(CD\)
any position of the tangent, which meets the axis in \(D\).
From the point of contact \(C\) draw the perpendicular \(CB\) ;
and, considering \(C\) as a point in the curve, put \(AB = x,
BC = y\) ; but again considering \(C\) as any point whatever
in the tangent, put \(AB = x', BC = y'\). Then, whatever
be the conditions that determine the position of the tangent,
the relation of a' and y', the co-ordinates of any point
in it, may be expressed by the equation \(y' = Px' + Q\),
where \(P\) and \(Q\) are put to denote generally certain functions
of constant quantities, and some quantity \(p\), which
has the same value for any given position of the tangent,
but which changes its value if the tangent changes its
position. For example, \(p\) may express the angle which
the tangent makes with the axis, or it may represent the
subtangent \(BD, \text{&c.}\)
</p>
<p>
Let us now suppose that the variable quantity \(p\) changes
its value, and becomes \(p + h\), and that \(C'D'\) is the
new position of the tangent corresponding to \(p + h\) ;
then, considering \(P\) and \(Q\) as functions of \(p\), by Taylor’s
theorem (art. 31),

</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
From these equations it is easy to eliminate the trigonometrical
quantities cos p and sin p, and the result will
be the equation of the curve, which is an epicycloid. The
curve in question is the catacauslic curve to a circle.
It is easy to see that the general problem, of which
we have now given two examples, is very comprehensive.
We may evidently find, by the folmulæ (1) and (2), catacaustic
and diacaustic curves in all cases whatever. These,
and an infinite number of other geometrical problems, are
contained in the following more general problem.
</p>

<h3>
Problem 3.
</h3>
<p>
Determine the nature of a curve which touches an infinite
number of lines of a given kind, described upon a
plane according to some determinate law. For example,
suppose the lines to be parabolas described by a projectile
thrown from an engine with a given velocity, at every
possible elevation in a vertical plane.
</p>
<p>
Let \(HCD\) be any one of the lines of a given kind (a parabola,
for example), and suppose it referred to an axis \(AB\),
by the rectangular co-ordinates \(AB = x'\) and \(BC = y'\). Let
\(p\) denote some quantity belonging to the line or curve
\(HCD\), which has always the same value in the same
curve, but which has different values in different curves.
Thus, if the curve be a circle, \(p\) may be its radius ; or if
the curve be a parabola, \(p\) may be its parameter, &c.
This quantity \(p\) may also by analogy be called the <i>parameter</i>
of the curve \(HCD\). Let us suppose the nature of
this curve to be expressed by the equation
	\[f(x', y', p) = 0 \tag{1}\]
that is, let some function of \(x', y’\), and \(p\), be supposed \(= 0\).
If \(p\) now be supposed to change its value, and become
\(p + h\), then the curve \(HCD\) will change its figure, and
have some other position \(H'C'D'\). Let \(AB' = x''\), and \(B'C'

= y''\), be any co-ordinates of this other curve, and as, by
hypothesis, the two curves are expressed by equations of
the same form, we must have
	\[f(x'', y'', p + h) = 0 ;\]
and this expression, by Taylor’s theorem, is equivalent to
	\[f(x'', y'', p) + {d\left\{f(x'',y'',p)\right\} \over dp}h + K h^2 + \text{&c.},\]
the differential being taken upon the hypothesis that \(p\)
alone is variable, and \(K h^2 + \text{&c.}\) being put for all terms
of the series following the second, each of which is multiplied
by a power of \(h\).
</p>


<h2>
Investigation of the Properties of the Catenary
</h2>
<p>
Suppose a chain or thread of uniform thickness, and
perfectly flexible, but inextensible, to be fastened by its
extremities at two points \(A, B\) in a vertical plane ; by the
action of gravity it will take the form of a curve \(ACPB\),
called the <i>catenary</i>.
</p>
<p>
The curve will evidently be all in one plane, and a horizontal
line \(CD\), in that plane, at \(C\) its lowest point, will
manifestly touch the curve, which is retained at rest by a
mutual balancing of the forces produced by the weight of
the particles of the chain.
</p>
<p>
If we suppose its lowest point to be fixed at \(C\), it is easy
to understand that the part \(BC\) will not on that account
change in the least its figure, because the tension of the
chain at \(C\), when it was free, is now replaced by the reaction
of the force exerted in the horizontal direction
\(CD\). 
</p>
<p>
The forces exerted on the points \(B, C\) will evidently be
the same in quantity and in direction, whether the chain
be considered as flexible, or rigid like a solid wire ; hence
it may be regarded as kept at rest by three forces, viz.
its gravity acting vertically, and the re-actions of the tensions
at \(B\) and \(C\) ; the former exerted in the direction of
a tangent to the curve at \(B\), and the latter in the direction
\(CD\), the tangent at the lowest point \(C\).
</p>
<p>
In like manner any portion \(PC\) between \(P\) and its lowest
point may be considered as kept at rest by the joint
action of the gravity of the mass \(PC\), the tension of the
chain at \(C\), which is constant, and the tension at \(P\), which
is variable ; and by the nature of an equilibrium (Mechanics),
these forces will be to each other as the sides of
any triangle which are parallel to their directions. Draw
a horizontal line \(OX\) in the plane of the curve as an axis,
meeting the vertical through \(C\) in \(O\), which may be taken
as an origin of co-ordinates ; draw \(PQ\) perpendicular
to \(OX\), and \(PT\) touching the curve and meeting the axis
in T. From what has been explained, the tension of the
curve at C will be to the weight of the matter in \(PC\) as
\(TQ\) to \(PQ\), that is, as radius to the tangent of the angle
which \(PT\) makes with any horizontal line.
Put \(OQ = x, PQ = y, \text{arc }CP = z, \text{angle }PTQ = p\) ;
and let a be the tension of the curve at the vertex \(C\) : we
have then \(a :z = 1 :\tan \varphi\) ; hence
	\[\tan \varphi = {z \over a} \tag{1}\]
</p>
<p>
This is the distinguishing property of the curve, from
which we are to deduce its other properties.
</p>
<p>
From equation (1), by differentiation,
	\[{d\varphi \over \cos^2\varphi} = {dz \over a}.\]
</p>
<p>
Now in all curves,
	\[dz = {dx \over \cos \varphi} = {dy \over \sin \varphi} ;\]
hence we obtain
	\[dx = a \cdot {d\varphi \over \cos \varphi},
		dy = a \cdot {d\varphi \sin\varphi \over \cos \varphi}.\]
From these, by integration,
	\[x = a \ln \tan(45° + {1 \over 2}\varphi) + \text{const. (art. 155)}\]
	\[y = {a \over \cos \varphi} + \text{const.}\]
If we assume that \(OC\) measures the tension at \(C\), which
is a constant quantity, then because when \(\varphi = 0, x = 0\),
and \(y = a\), we have the relation of the quantities \(x, y, \varphi\),
expressed by these equations,
	\[x = a \ln \tan(45° + {1 \over 2}\varphi),
		y = {a \over \cos \varphi} = a \sec \varphi. \tag{2}\]
The constant line a is called the <i>parameter</i> of the curve,
also its <i>modulus</i>. From the first of these equations, putting
for \(45° + {1 \over 2}\varphi\), we have
	\[\tan \psi = e^{x \over a}, \cot \psi = e^{-x \over a},\]
	\[\tan \psi + \cot \psi = e^{x \over a} + e^{-x \over a}.\]
Now
	\[\tan \psi + \cot \psi = {\sin \psi \over \cos \psi} + {\cos \psi \over \sin \psi}
		= {2 \over \sin 2\psi} = {2 \over \cos \varphi} = {2y \over a} ;\]
therefore
	\[y = {a \over 2}\left\{e^{x \over a} + e^{-x \over a}\right\}. \tag{3}\]
This exponential equation expresses the relation between
x and y by means of e, the base of Napier’s logarithms.
From this last equation, observing that \(y = a\sec\varphi\),
we get
	\[\sec^2\varphi = {1 \over 4}\left\{e^{2x \over a} + e^{-2x \over a} + 2\right\},\]
	\[\sec^2\varphi - 1 = {1 \over 4}\left\{e^{2x \over a} + e^{-2x \over a} - 2\right\},\]
	\[\tan \varphi = \sqrt{\sec^2\varphi - 1}
		= {1 \over 2}\left\{e^{x \over a} - e^{-x \over a}\right\}.\]
But it was found that \(z = a \tan\varphi\), therefore
	\[z = {a \over 2}\left\{e^{x \over a} - e^{-x \over a}\right\}. \tag{4}\]
From formulæ (3) and (4) we have
	\[y + z = a e^{x \over a}, y - z = a e^{-x \over a}, \tag{5}\]
	\[\text{therefore }y^2 - z^2 = a^2, \tag{6}\]
hence again,
	\[y = \sqrt{a^2 + z^2}, z = \sqrt{y^2 - a^2}, \tag{7}\]
and since from formula (5)
	\[{x \over a} = \ln {y + z \over a} = \ln{a \over y - z}, \tag{8}\]
therefore also,
	\[{x \over a}
		\begin{cases}
			= \ln{y + \sqrt{y^2 - a^2} \over a} \\
			= \ln{z + \sqrt{z^2 + a^2} \over a} \\
		\end{cases}.
	\tag{9}\]
</p>
<p>
Let s denote the area bounded by the \(\text{arc }PC\) and the
straight lines \(CO, OQ, PQ\) ; then, since \(dx = {ad\varphi \over \cos\varphi}\),
and \(y = {a \over \cos\varphi}\), therefore
	\[ds = y dx = {a^2d\varphi \over \cos^2\varphi} = a dz,\]
	\[\text{and } s = az. \tag{10}\]
</p>
<p>
Thus it appears that the arc \(CP\) is always proportional
to the conterminous area \(CPQO\). It is evident that the
catenary, if inverted, would form an equilibrated arch.
From this property it appears that if a wall, whose height
above the crown of the arch is equal to the line \(CO\), be
horizontal at the top, the structure thus formed will constitute
an equilibrated arch with a straight roadway.
(See on this subject our article Arch.) (w. w.)
